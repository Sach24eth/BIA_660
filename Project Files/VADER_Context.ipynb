There was no mention in our confirmation email or at check-in that you had to request a Nespresso machine for your room, something that is included in the daily additional $35 facility fee. Also, I paid extra for a city view room, (which their website describe as skyline views, including the Freedom Tower) and I was on the 9th floor (of 20), looking into office windows across the street.

      " Very expensive for the tiniest room and smallest bathroom possible. We requested more towels for the room and it took over an hour to get them. We left after the first night because we werenâ€™t happy with our stay and service. Two different people gave us different explanations of their cancellation policy, even when the reason we were leaving was the bad customer service and terrible room. Finally the manager spoke with us and said that we would only be charged for the one night we stayed and no other fees would be charged. I just saw my credit card bill with charges and I was definitely charged more than the one night stay. Very dissatisfied with my experience staying in this hotel.\n",

The bathroom had a really cool lighting however the door is extremely heavy so be very careful as the door slammed on my fingers really hard. The amenities in the room were also really cool that a smart TV with free showtime you can also log into your Netflix. Additionally there is also some really great bath shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms that smell really fresh almost like eucalyptus. The sink was actually outside of the bathroom, FYI.\n",

The room was well organize with a small â€œoffice spaceâ€. Quiet most of the time, you can barely hear NYC sounds (ambulance, FDNY or NYPD sirens). I would like to thank the two managers that made our stay extra special Travis and Alex and the girsl at the coffeeshop in the morning Stephanie and Taniaa, they were amazing and  made my breakfast extra fun!!\n",

Hector was such great help when he realized my stay wasnâ€™t the correct amount of nights I needed but didnâ€™t hesitate to fix it for me. Was also convenient that the bar had extra bottle openers to give me to open some drinks I had in my room. Stayed on the 22nd floor with gorgeous views and was a good size for an NYC hotel. Bed was super comfy and bathroom was amazing considering someone could use the sink while someone is showering. Overall 10/10 stay and would def recommend for anyone whether it be a quickâ€¦\n",

      " My first stay at the Motto was relatively without issue. If it hadnâ€™t rained the first night, it would have been the perfect staycation. the neatest part of the king bed frame is the cutouts in the bottom to store your extra luggage. I had a fantastic 30th floor view of the Freedom Tower and even had a little desk nook next to the bed where I was able to take professional Zoom calls when necessary. The bed was super comfy, the shower was mood-changing, and the room just big enough to not feel like I was staying in a closet, like other rooms Iâ€™ve seen in NYC!\n",

      " The Motto Hotel was an amazing stay in Chelsea. Check in was quick and efficient. Our room was 3003 which has an outstanding view of  South of Chelsea including the World Trade Center. The size of the room is comparable to a Miami boutique size with plenty of modern amenities and a unique use of space. Overall Iâ€™d stay there again.\n",

I really enjoyed all the storage underneath the bed & the hooks which made everything organized and didnâ€™t have our luggage / items taking up space in the room. The staff were incredibly welcoming from Hector at the front desk, China at the bar and Sammy the hotel manager who asked about our stay and was genuinely interested in making sure our stay was fantastic. Overall we would recommend to anyone staying in NYC, great location and great hotel!\n",

Upon our check in, we were welcomed by the manager on duty - Hector. He helped us go through the arrival process and even went to lengths in describing room options, pricing and brief introduction of the brand/hotel, to which we are grateful for his patience and hospitality. We decided to go for a room with 2 beds (full size) - little did we know Hectorâ€¦\n",

The room was beautiful with an even better view! Loved being able to watch the sunrise in bed while being able to see the Statue of Liberty. The staff Sam was extremely helpful when it came time to check out. We will be back and in hopes to have the same rooms with the beautiful views. This stay was worth every penny!\n"

      " Booked a queen room, 12/10-12, holiday, busy in NYC. Dropped off our bags, toured the city, checked in and was told they oversold and could only offer us bunk beds. I said it was unacceptable, that I wanted a queen beds and the front desk person offered for me to cancel the reservation, nothing more. I booked through a third party and knew I could not get my money back if I cancelled the reservation, so he was basically offering me nothing. I asked to speak to the manager - John Paul, and he told me he would comp us the first night and give us a free drink at the bar. This was at 10pm and we were very tired so we accepted, went up to the room and went to bed. an hour later (we were asleep), John Paul calledâ€¦\n",

      " The location was about a 8-10min walk into Times Square  Going past madam Tussaud's and Ridley's believe it or not We got a Uber from Newark and it was about $56 one way. Rooms were small but it's just a Base, we had bunk beds and you know what it was fine, you get what you pay for and we only needed somewhere to sleep it's better then a hostel. The check in staff was lovely, in general I was pleased with all the staff. Tv was great and I loved the little touches by the bedside like charging points USB and plug, night light  I would stay here again, but ideally need to be a bit more closer to Timesâ€¦\n",

Plenty of dinining options near by; never had a meal at the Polynesian room on the premis, but had a couple of drinks and coffee and pastry in the morning. Room was very clean, nice shower setup and the beds were elevated to allow for storage underneath. One slight annoyance is the two elevator banks you have to take to get to your room; especially when the one to the lobby broke down for a couple days. Three minor cons were no in room coffee, nolotion (I asked at front desk and they did not have any) and just the street noise.\n",

      " We just returned from a two night stay at the Residence Inn New York Downtown Manhattan/World Trade Center Area and I can't recommended it enough!!! Special shout to Jane at the front desk and the rest of the staff, everyone was extremely welcoming and accommodating. The Maiden Lane studio suite was extremely comfortable (much bigger than most NY hotel rooms) and we appreciate the hospitality!!! Breakfast was excellent and a perfect way to start the day. We look forward to another stay in the future!!\n",

      " A few minor issues really ruined the potential of this stay. Although I have status and booked an executive room, I was put into a room that was a total dark cave. The internal room gave no natural light. I went to dinner and at around 8:30pm, they let me know that they could not fix it and offered to move my room, but because I didnâ€™t plan on being back until late, I had to decline. There were a few redeeming qualities about the room. Frankly it was one of the largest NYC hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and the bed was very comfortable. Having a Kitchenette was very nice and the room was very clean. I would be willing to try again for another stay but hopefully they address the shower before renting the room (1016) again.\n",

      " Our experience at Residence Inn Manhattan World Trade Center was by no means as positive as our numerous previous stays at Residence Inn Manhattan Times Square! Prior to arrival I contacted the hotel through my app, and inquired if any upgrades were available, thinking that perhaps due to lowered occupancy, we might get a suite with a view. I was told the only upgrade would be to a room with 2 Queen beds which did not appeal to us. I certainly did not have a view, the room was dark due to looking out into a small space surrounded by buildings. While most of the staff were outstanding in pleasantries, professionalism and welcoming my wife and I, with one exception, and unfortunately he did not wear an ID to know his name!\n",

      " We got a free upgrade to a double Queen suite, room 1804. It was HUGE for a nyc hotel room and perfect for our family of four. Our kids, 9 and 7 like to sleep separately so the 9yr old  got the second queen and the 7yr old slept on the pullout couch in the living room area. For an adult the mattress on the pullout would have been horrendous (you can feel every spring) but he loved it and reported a great nights sleep. I would advise asking for the blankets and sheets for the pullout ahead of time- it took about 45mins for them to bring up when we finally thought to ask. And they donâ€™t keep them in the room. Also the blankets they supply for the pullout are thin compared to the bed blankets.\n",

      " I stay at the Residence frequently for work, and it's definitely my preferred hotel in Manhattan. The rooms are surprisingly large for NYC, and always very clean. I like the full bottles of shampoo etc in the shower, and having a fridge is useful for longer stays. The front desk staff is super nice and friendly - Jessica always remembers me and checks me in super quickly. I LOVE having a Peloton in the gym - for a small gym, Marriott is really putting in usable amenities.\n",

Super clean and rooms are very large. Full fridge, microwave and dishes. Bathroom has toiletries and the towels and sheets were very nice. Comfortable bed. We arrived at 3 in the morning and it was nice to know that the front door is locked between 11p-6a and you have to ring the desk to get in, after giving them our name they opened the door and then we learned that we can only access the lobby without a room key.

We had a room with 2 queen beds instead of the 2 double beds we usually get in NYC. The breakfast room has lots of Starbucks coffee. They post the busy times for breakfast and they are right-on.

We're lucky to get early check in so we don't need worry about anything and went to see around the city instantly.

Just outside the hotel is a 24 hours McDonalds, a Walgreens and shopping and many other places. Only complaint is that the beds were very firm and the feather pillows were too crunchy.\n",

We had a nice view of Fulton Street and we were on a quiet floor ( 6th). The bed was very comfy and soft--- we had the best sleep-- I couldn't ask for anything better.

I typically do not have many needs when it comes to the type of room I stay in, but having it clean is one need for sure. When I went down to front desk to let them know, Jane was immediately extremely apologetic and told me there have been issues with housecleaning since the recent change in management.

The view from my room on the 17th floor was absolutely beautiful & I never had to wait too long for an elevator so it was great. the price was extremely reasonable & the room was nice sized. I stayed in a king suite with a kitchen it so it had a fridge, stove, dishwasher, sink & Dishes and cutlery.\n",

Finally i was told if I needed room service they needed 24 hr notice, I gave them three of those just in case and came back and still nothing was done.

      " The customer service at Homewood Suites NYC Midtown Manhattan is superior. Idris, Henry, and Samir greeted us upon our arrival and helped us several times throughout our 4 night stay. I was able to check in earlier than anticipated. After a long flight and lugging our luggage through Manhattan, I could have just hugged each of them for getting us our room to relax for a bit before hitting the sights! Beds were comfy, room was large, and the fitness center has a lot of options and is large. The upper floor patio available to all is a quiet oasis from the busy streetâ€¦\n",

The toilet was also clogged but apparently there was no maintenance person working, a security member eventually came with a plunger.

Some room for improvement in our opinion, breakfast was very busy, had to queue to get in any time after 8. We also had issues with the service, front of house staff didn't know how to help at times or didn't want to help which we haven't had in USA before as they're usually very welcoming people. Final comments were having tea/coffee available to residents, paying a lot of money to stay but there were no facilities and we had to buy one from the cafe. We also had to pay an extra $21 per night for room cleaning, again for the price why is this not included, or optional, I didn't need room cleaning for a 4 night stay and would rather not pay extra if I had the choice.\n",

He gave us complimentary early check-in (as we arrived way before the checkin time) & allocated us a room on the 23rd floor with amazing views of Times Square. The rooms itself was very comfortable and spotless. It was on the smaller side, typical for New York but was more than enough room for 2 people and 3 suitcases. The maids service was particularly good as well, rooms were tidied and beds made every day.\n",

The rest of my party took awhile to get set up. Room 822 was very small. I found hairs everywhere and asked for a new room. The new room was better, bigger. My daughter and I prepare for bed and I see specks of BLOOD stains on the inside of the sheets.\n",

Our rooms would apparently be ready the next morning, but in the meantime we would have to get a taxi to another hotel, the M Social, which I have to say was a better hotel. The following morning we had to get a taxi back to the Riu as our rooms would be ready, this then ate into the plans we had for our first day in New York and really tainted the experience.\n",

      " My friend and I arrived at this hotel on 1/12/21 and stayed for 6 nights. We were given a room on the 8th floor ,the lifts are an absolute nightmare to use and be prepared to go up and down before getting to your floor. The room was ok ,very modern- no kettle though so if you like a drink in your room youâ€™ll need to take a travel kettle with you. There is also a fridge in the room ,but if you leave a room key in  the slot so the electric can stay on be prepared for it to be taken away by the maid. Rooms were quite dusty ,surfaces arenâ€™t wiped over. Any glasses or cups ,cutlery etc taken to your room will be there for the whole of your stay.\n",

No room available to move us to until later that day, the manager suggested we stay in the other bed as we had twin beds as my daughter had not seen any bugs in her bed!!! we weren't happy to stay in the room so packed our belonging up and took them to be stored.

Location turned out to be great - under 10 min to Times Square and several options for subway stops within 5-10 min walking time. They tried, but they clearly didn't know how to do a number of tasks. Check in was fairly efficient, but a very unexpected \"surprise\" was $20 per night \"facilities fee\".\n",

The family suite, has 2 rooms with 2 beds in 1 room and 1 bed in the 2nd room. During check-in, the receptionist first asked me if I booked a room with 1 bed. After which I indicated that my room was supposed to have 3 beds. The confirmation sent from TripAdvisor had  a room name that had a name different from any on their website, so he refused to honor the reservation. Ended up with a single room with 2 beds and a couch.

I understand that you will be charged if you want to pre book an early check in, but when you arrive - if there is no room, it's one thing, but if there is room - why not give the room for free?

The location was good for all major attractions and subway, the free Wi-Fi was good and you get complimentary use of the nespresso machine which was good. The room could do with updating but by no means in a bad standard.\n",

Shortly after we got to our room we realized the bathroom door didnâ€™t close, we called down and within 10 minutes they had someone up there to fix it. The room was beautiful with an even better view! Loved being able to watch the sunrise in bed while being able to see the Statue of Liberty. We will be back and in hopes to have the same rooms with the beautiful views.\n",

While I donâ€™t go to NYC to go to Time Square, it is a short walk away, along with other tourist hot spots like theaters. Loads of eating options in Hellâ€™s Kitchen are also a short walk as is the Lincoln Center. Request a higher floor if possible, not just for amazing views but the noise from the in hotel bar/club can be a bit annoying if youâ€™re on one of the lower floors.\n",

In the middle of and walking distance from all the major sites of Manhattan. Laundry room is inexpensive to use and wonderful for families who packed light and need to wash. Eugy, the service ambassador, goes well beyond her job description to help families feel at home; especially families like mine who have a member who sees the world in a different way due to autism.\n",

The key thing is itâ€™s a sliding door and has a gap so u never have a closed door  so to be blunt as you sat on the pan you could watch the tv through the gap â€¦â€¦Iâ€™ll end there and you can decide for yourselves the other issues a gapped toilet door may provide   Breakfast very organised but I didnâ€™t eat on last day Iâ€¦\n",

If more than 2 people in the room you'd be to tight Hot water hit or miss out of six showers taken 2 were cold Bathroom is not private you can see the persons silhouette when showering  Breakfast Buffet has a lot of choices but all the hot items were cold If your looking for a bed to sleep in and nothing else you can't beat the price.\n",

The bathroom is stupid with frosted glass walls so you can see the silhouette of naked person from bedroom and during the night if someone needs to use the bathroom the light shines into bedroom.\n",

      " Very attentive especially the night employees at the front desk and housekeeping! We feel terrible because we had minutes to get to our train and forgot to leave a tip for the hard workers that cleaned our rooms. The gym was great they even had a skipping rope which I have never seen before so I was very happy. The tv was very spotty but it was not that big of deal seeing as we didn't spend a lot of time in the room even with our 6 year old.\n",

There are several cool outdoor lounging areas which is great for pandemic safety. We were able to get takeout and eat it in an outdoor lounge. Overall, we loved it and would absolutely stay again if the price is right. The lobby & areas are fun spaces, the elevator has interesting decor, it's just so clean and lovely, and we got a good deal. Which was great, it's just a really odd thing to add a \"resort fee\" for things that are completely standard offerings.\n",

      " Location was brilliant, very close to main Times Square attractions and close to lots of subway lines to explore the whole city. The hotel itself was clean and rooms were a reasonable size and had all amenities. Final comments were having tea/coffee available to residents, paying a lot of money to stay but there were no facilities and we had to buy one from the cafe. We also had to pay an extra $21 per night for room cleaning, again for the price why is this not included, or optional, I didn't need room cleaning for a 4 night stay and would rather not pay extra if I had the choice. Hotel has a lot of potential and I would return but wanted to feedback on a few little things that could make it a great place!\n",

The bathroom is stupid with frosted glass walls so you can see the silhouette of naked person from bedroom and during the night if someone needs to use the bathroom the light shines into bedroom.\n",

      " I have tried their restaurant a few times since the restaurant's opening. Lovely atmosphere of the restaurant and lounge. Friendly staff and love all the food they serve at the restaurant. I have busy work schedules, and I need a local getaway, so I also decided to try the hotel and make a reservation with Hector for staying in the hotel, and he arranged my stay at 39floorsr with a beautiful night view of NYC. Helpful restaurant managers Baron and Alex  Last but not least, thank you for the chefs Dirk that provided me with the best special hot sauce!\n",

As with other Residence Inns weâ€™ve stayed at, itâ€™s a real plus to have a kitchenette in the room and features like self service laundry. Initial staff that checked us in were very warm and welcoming. I appreciate them sending out text messages letting us know our room was ready, and I was impressed when they sent a text the following day asking how our room and stay was. A few imperfections we encountered: one member of the front desk staff in the evening, a large framed older man, was not very friendly or helpful.\n",

(We couldnâ€™t hang around as had theatre tickets booked) bags came on our last full day no one bothered to ring the room in the morning we only got them by queuing for reception again. Despite booking a king size room we were given a twin no one ever tried to rectify this at any point.\n",

      " The staff is what ruined my stay at this hotel. My family stayed 5 nights and I can honestly say each encounter we had with the staff was not pleasant. I thought maybe the first encounter was just someone having a bad day, but when it kept happening I came to the conclusion that they lacked customer service. In addition if you need to call the front desk they do not answer.\n",

The room was lacking things I've come to take  for granted like a clock and a coffee maker (or at least a coffee stand  in the lobby) The rooms are small if you have more than one person and there is no dresser or  surface to place clothing other than a small desk area.\n",

Balcony more of a patio and fun but needed more attention to plantings. There is a noticeable presence of apparent homeless in streets but not inside. Key security. I am hard to please since I used to travel for work all the time, but was happy. â€¦\n",

Breakfast was included and we definitely didn't starve! We didn't have to que at all but our body clocks were very mixed up and we were down there when it opened. Happy hour between 5-9pm was a bonus (wine and cocktails). We also had a drink in the attached cafe before we came home which was fine. â€¦\n",
