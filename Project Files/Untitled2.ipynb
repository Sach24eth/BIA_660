      " Hotel and room were very clean upon arrival. But… we stayed for 3 nights and received no housekeeping during our stay! There was no mention in our confirmation email or at check-in that you had to request a Nespresso machine for your room, something that is included in the daily additional $35 facility fee. Also, I paid extra for a city view room, (which their website describe as skyline views, including the Freedom Tower) and I was on the 9th floor (of 20), looking into office windows across the street. And be prepared for the tiniest bathroom I have ever had, including in Europe. An OK place, but room for better communication and oversight.\n",

Christina helped us to get the same room for an extra day and she got a car service to the airport when the one we had reservations called 30 minutes before our pick up time. Alex was amazing at check in and his recommendations for dinner were \"great\" The Hotel is in a great location and a modern vibe/design. Common areas are clean but I can't say the same for the room.

We left after the first night because we weren’t happy with our stay and service. Two different people gave us different explanations of their cancellation policy, even when the reason we were leaving was the bad customer service and terrible room. Finally the manager spoke with us and said that we would only be charged for the one night we stayed and no other fees would be charged. I just saw my credit card bill with charges and I was definitely charged more than the one night stay. Very dissatisfied with my experience staying in this hotel.\n",

We paid extra for a \"CITY VIEW\" room and expected to either see the financial district  downtown or of the Empire State building and etc uptown. The picture of the \"City View\" room online is taken from one of those top three floors, we were on floor 13 and had a \"view\" of the building across…\n",

      " We came to visit our family and stayed at the Innside hotel for 8 days. We didn't know what to expect, and we were very pleased to find a place to which we certainly will come back. It continues when you discover you arrived at a new hotel with spacious rooms relative to what is acceptable in Manhattan. In summary a hotel where the corridors are quiet and clean and, in the lobby, and restaurant next door you will always find young people that create a great atmosphere.\n",

We appreciate that Christina and Alex went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable and memorable by offering us great restaurant and activity recommendations. Our check-in experience was flawless, the rooms were clean and well-designed, the location was central, and the gym on the 20th floor was fantastic. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an enjoyable stay in NYC!\n",

Even though we got there several hours before check-in time, Monique was able to offer us an available room right away. The room was immediately inviting with a gorgeous city view, modern furnishings, and a comfy bed with plush pillows – perfect to plop down on after a busy day in the city. One of our favorite parts of the room was the full-sized bath and body products that were plant based and had a great relaxing mint scent.\n",

Hector was such great help when he realized my stay wasn’t the correct amount of nights I needed but didn’t hesitate to fix it for me. Was also convenient that the bar had extra bottle openers to give me to open some drinks I had in my room. Stayed on the 22nd floor with gorgeous views and was a good size for an NYC hotel. Bed was super comfy and bathroom was amazing considering someone could use the sink while someone is showering. Overall 10/10 stay and would def recommend for anyone whether it be a quick…\n",

      " My first stay at the Motto was relatively without issue. If it hadn’t rained the first night, it would have been the perfect staycation. the neatest part of the king bed frame is the cutouts in the bottom to store your extra luggage. I had a fantastic 30th floor view of the Freedom Tower and even had a little desk nook next to the bed where I was able to take professional Zoom calls when necessary. The bed was super comfy, the shower was mood-changing, and the room just big enough to not feel like I was staying in a closet, like other rooms I’ve seen in NYC!\n",

      " Our stay at Motto Hilton was more than exceptional. The rooms were spacious and comfortable with a modern flare. We were fortunate enough to have the option to create an ample suite through connecting rooms. The view from our suite was breathtaking and the location was more than convenient with shops and restaurants at walking distance.\n",

We were on a 37th floor room, the view to lower Manhattan was breathtaking, even our dog enjoyed the view, the room had everything you'll need, the food in the restaurant was amazing, we even had the pleasure to meet the famous chef Fabio Viviani, the drinks at the bar were also expectacular.

      " We stayed here for a concert that was at Madison square garden. Shortly after we got to our room we realized the bathroom door didn’t close, we called down and within 10 minutes they had someone up there to fix it. The room was beautiful with an even better view! Loved being able to watch the sunrise in bed while being able to see the Statue of Liberty. The staff Sam was extremely helpful when it came time to check out. We will be back and in hopes to have the same rooms with the beautiful views. This stay was worth every penny!\n",

It was the perfect size: the bed was huge and comfortable and the decor and the art gave the room a luxury feel. Inside of the room, there is a cute seating area for your workspace needs that is connected to the bed and as a professional, I find that feature very necessary.\n",

      " Very small room (as expected) but it was bigger than a cruise ship cabin. Clean hotel, nice employees, great view from our room. Make sure you’re traveling with someone you’re comfortable showering in front of, because the frosted glass bathroom walls means you’ll be showering in front of your roommate. I found the bed uncomfortably firm. They didn’t need to waste money buying a bed because the floor would’ve been as comfortable. Overall, though, cleanliness and location give this room a thumbs up from me.\n",

Not only did they meet our room requirements, they added extra touches in the room to make my mums birthday extra special! The rooms themselves are a perfect size (yes they aren’t huge rooms but this really wasn’t a problem). There was enough room for the two of us, 2 hand-luggage cases and a large cabin case.

      " Just stayed at the Pod for 5 days for a work trip. Plenty of dinining options near by; never had a meal at the Polynesian room on the premis, but had a couple of drinks and coffee and pastry in the morning. Room was very clean, nice shower setup and the beds were elevated to allow for storage underneath. One slight annoyance is the two elevator banks you have to take to get to your room; especially when the one to the lobby broke down for a couple days. Three minor cons were no in room coffee, nolotion (I asked at front desk and they did not have any) and just the street noise.\n",

      " A few minor issues really ruined the potential of this stay. Although I have status and booked an executive room, I was put into a room that was a total dark cave. The internal room gave no natural light. I went to dinner and at around 8:30pm, they let me know that they could not fix it and offered to move my room, but because I didn’t plan on being back until late, I had to decline. There were a few redeeming qualities about the room. Frankly it was one of the largest NYC hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and the bed was very comfortable. Having a Kitchenette was very nice and the room was very clean. I would be willing to try again for another stay but hopefully they address the shower before renting the room (1016) again.\n",

I was told the only upgrade would be to a room with 2 Queen beds which did not appeal to us. I certainly did not have a view, the room was dark due to looking out into a small space surrounded by buildings.

      " We got a free upgrade to a double Queen suite, room 1804. It was HUGE for a nyc hotel room and perfect for our family of four. Our kids, 9 and 7 like to sleep separately so the 9yr old  got the second queen and the 7yr old slept on the pullout couch in the living room area. For an adult the mattress on the pullout would have been horrendous (you can feel every spring) but he loved it and reported a great nights sleep. I would advise asking for the blankets and sheets for the pullout ahead of time- it took about 45mins for them to bring up when we finally thought to ask. And they don’t keep them in the room. Also the blankets they supply for the pullout are thin compared to the bed blankets.\n",

I like the full bottles of shampoo etc in the shower, and having a fridge is useful for longer stays.

When we returned the desk staff (who had actually apologised that our room wasn’t ready after our long flight) had our room keys already to go, even with the wi-fi password written on the envelope 2, the room itself was enormous, full kitchen with hob and dishwasher, comfy sofa bed, spacious bathroom and 2 queen beds.

We arrived at 3 in the morning and it was nice to know that the front door is locked between 11p-6a and you have to ring the desk to get in, after giving them our name they opened the door and then we learned that we can only access the lobby without a room key.

      " After staying in 2 other supposedly 4 stars and highly rated on Tripadvisor hotels in the area while our apartment was being renovated, we were wary of going to another hotel and being sorely disappointed. From the moment we checked into the lobby to when we finally stepped into our room, we were SO happy to finally find a place to call home (at least temporarily). The hotel is clean, the staff members are helpful and polite, and the rooms are well-designed. The high ceilings made the room seem bigger than it really is. The room was quiet and we didn't hear our neighbours.\n",

      " Just had a wonderful Hilton experience at the Homewood Suites Times Square on West 37th Street in NYC. *** Due to some safety issues, I had to vacate my 92 year old mom from her NYC apartment and find us two adjoining rooms for a few nights. But they went one better and called the Manager to ask him to preblock adjoining rooms. When I arrived, the Front Desk said no way. I asked them to check the notes and BOOM there it was - two adjoining rooms blocked off. Rooms were spotless and super quiet. Perfect kitchenette, great bathroom and fluffy towels.\n",

We had a very comfortable bed and equally comfortable sofa bed - amazing! The sound insulation was fantastic, we really enjoyed the peace and quiet in the room. The kitchenette was so useful for our family, and we especially loved the full refrigerator. The morning buffet breakfast was excellent and varied every day, great way to start the day! We loved that there was an outdoor patio to have breakfast, it made us feel so safe!\n",

      " My boyfriend and I wanted a change of scenery with working remotely and decided to head to New York and stay at the Homewood Suites by Hilton New York/Midtown Manhattan - and it was a 5-star experience!! The staff was very accommodating, especially JL who helped me find a quiet place to work ( video zoom meeting)  when the business center was fully taken. The hotel has a gym, a full kitchen in your room, a free breakfast and it does not disappoint - fresh eggs/omelet, steak/turkey sausage, hashbrowns/potatoes, oatmeal, and the normal continental.\n",

When we got to the room, it was tiny--not the room I had reserved. When I told the front desk staff, they first insisted that this was the room I had booked.

It was a family trip and as such, we got the 2 queen bed rooms on the 18th floor. Both my husband and my younger son hit their head on those lamps twice. The only way to avoid it is if they slept further down the bed and moved their pillow away from the headboard.\n",

      " Stayed for four nights to celebrate 30th birthday. The hotel itself was clean and rooms were a reasonable size and had all amenities. Some room for improvement in our opinion, breakfast was very busy, had to queue to get in any time after 8. We also had issues with the service, front of house staff didn't know how to help at times or didn't want to help which we haven't had in USA before as they're usually very welcoming people. Final comments were having tea/coffee available to residents, paying a lot of money to stay but there were no facilities and we had to buy one from the cafe. We also had to pay an extra $21 per night for room cleaning, again for the price why is this not included, or optional, I didn't need room cleaning for a 4 night stay and would rather not pay extra if I had the choice.\n",

Our bags were lost by the airline and we had to queue in the long line every day to check if they had arrived; surely the hotel could have emailed us/rang the from? Each time this was a saga, one day there were bags that could have been ours but wouldn’t check until the manager had finished interviewing?! (We couldn’t hang around as had theatre tickets booked) bags came on our last full day no one bothered to ring the room in the morning we only got them by queuing for reception again. Despite booking a king size room we were given a twin no one ever tried to rectify this at any point.\n",

      " My friend and I arrived at this hotel on 1/12/21 and stayed for 6 nights. We were given a room on the 8th floor ,the lifts are an absolute nightmare to use and be prepared to go up and down before getting to your floor. The room was ok ,very modern- no kettle though so if you like a drink in your room you’ll need to take a travel kettle with you. There is also a fridge in the room ,but if you leave a room key in  the slot so the electric can stay on be prepared for it to be taken away by the maid. Rooms were quite dusty ,surfaces aren’t wiped over. Any glasses or cups ,cutlery etc taken to your room will be there for the whole of your stay.\n",

Water replenished in rooms which is good and very comfortable bed. Did have issues with the bedroom door where we were locked out reception were excellent at mobilising an engineer however he either didn’t turn up or carry out the works but consistently lied to reception which is not their fault - this cause us to be locked out of the room for 1hour waiting in the corridor.\n",

      " I really enjoyed my stay here!!! From the time I checked in until I left, I was so happy that I stayed here. It is literally 1 block from the Theatre District AND from the double-decker tour pick-up bus stop that I went on Top View. The one thing I will say to new check-ins is that you need to use one of the room's card keys to insert into the lightbox AFTER you enter your hotel room and this will allow the lights to stay on. Aside from that, I was very happy with my stay here.\n",

      " First the good- great location, quiet rooms, clean, friendly staff, felt safe the entire time. The room was small but that is normal for NYC rooms. The negative- really humid in the room. My guess is that the bathroom fan isn’t strong enough for shower. The bathroom has a frosted wall and the shower has a clear door inside the bathroom. I don’t know what designer keeps selling hotels on this but please stop!! No privacy and any bathroom lights immediately illuminate the entire room.

I had to turn the lights off in room to shower though the shower head was great shampoo body wash smelled good. The power is turned on with your room key left inserted.

      " I only talked to the check in receptionist and the cleaning woman and they were both very friendly. I love this hotel because of the proximity to Times Square, Riu is only one block away. I've stayed at the Riu 3 times since it first opened. When it first opened of course the rooms were in better shape but they are still nice and clean now. Depending on the room you may have great view of the city. The only minor issue with the room is there was some noticeable water damage above the closet (picture attached) and some of the furniture was starting to wear but it was nothing too bad. I would definitely stay there again.\n",

      " We came upon this new hotel as we were driving along 6th avenue trying to find a parking space on a lazy Sunday and eventually decided to stay for the evening. At first sight the hotel was obviously in construction mode, finishing up the exterior details such as as the huge glass facade looking into 24th St. ; from the street, you have a clear view of the entirety of the interior - bar and a little of the upcoming restaurant. He helped us go through the arrival process and even went to lengths in describing room options, pricing and brief introduction of the brand/hotel, to which we are grateful for his patience and hospitality.\n",

Shortly after we got to our room we realized the bathroom door didn’t close, we called down and within 10 minutes they had someone up there to fix it. The room was beautiful with an even better view! Loved being able to watch the sunrise in bed while being able to see the Statue of Liberty. We will be back and in hopes to have the same rooms with the beautiful views.\n",

While I don’t go to NYC to go to Time Square, it is a short walk away, along with other tourist hot spots like theaters. Loads of eating options in Hell’s Kitchen are also a short walk as is the Lincoln Center. Request a higher floor if possible, not just for amazing views but the noise from the in hotel bar/club can be a bit annoying if you’re on one of the lower floors.\n",

There are several cool outdoor lounging areas which is great for pandemic safety. We were able to get takeout and eat it in an outdoor lounge. Overall, we loved it and would absolutely stay again if the price is right. The lobby & areas are fun spaces, the elevator has interesting decor, it's just so clean and lovely, and we got a good deal. Which was great, it's just a really odd thing to add a \"resort fee\" for things that are completely standard offerings.\n",

The breakfast buffet was decent and they worked hard to keep it clean during the time we attended. Very good coffee and great variety with the juice bar. Front desk was also great as was was the valet service.\n",

The room itself was great, even for just the studio, especially the oven. It was a great way to reheat leftover pizza from Eataly (which I could even see out of my window) in an actual convention oven so it got nice and crisp again.

      " Lots of homeless out front and staff that does not seem to care. We had to file multiple complaints with the front desk because of all the noise the cleaning crew was making at all hours of the day AND night. Constant banging because they would clean with the door security lock in place and every time they went into the room which was 20 to 30 times per room you would hear loud banging noises as the door would slam shut. There was also constant yelling in the hallways, and if you wanted to walk to your room you would have to walk over piles of used towels and bed linens which were stacked in the hallways.\n",

Felix, Lizbeth, and Ana were great hostesses. Beds were comfy, room was large, and the fitness center has a lot of options and is large.\n",

      " Location was brilliant, very close to main Times Square attractions and close to lots of subway lines to explore the whole city. The hotel itself was clean and rooms were a reasonable size and had all amenities. Final comments were having tea/coffee available to residents, paying a lot of money to stay but there were no facilities and we had to buy one from the cafe. We also had to pay an extra $21 per night for room cleaning, again for the price why is this not included, or optional, I didn't need room cleaning for a 4 night stay and would rather not pay extra if I had the choice. Hotel has a lot of potential and I would return but wanted to feedback on a few little things that could make it a great place!\n",

The bathroom is stupid with frosted glass walls so you can see the silhouette of naked person from bedroom and during the night if someone needs to use the bathroom the light shines into bedroom.\n",

The one thing I will say to new check-ins is that you need to use one of the room's card keys to insert into the lightbox AFTER you enter your hotel room and this will allow the lights to stay on.

Check in was later than we thought (3pm), but the hotel held our bags so we could go explore.\n",

      " I have a fully flexible reservation for June that states it can be cancelled with 24 hours notice. I made this reservation directly on the POD Times Square website. I have not yet paid anything, but my credit card was taken to hold the reservation. I attempted to cancel the reservation on their website, but the website says it can't cancel the reservation and gives an email address and a phone number to use to cancel. I have tried to call that phone number, as well as the phone number on my reservation email, many times and there is never any answer, it just rings and rings. I have emailed the email address on the website, replied to my reservation email, and emailed some direct emails that I saw in other Tripadvisor reviews, all requesting to cancel my reservation.\n",

We decided to pay with my husband credit card ( this was a long time ago, but i believe we paid with a credit card to avoid 50 pounds charge , something like that)  I have a bank statement that show the full amount of the booking was taken from my husband credit card !!!\n",

      " The staff is what ruined my stay at this hotel. My family stayed 5 nights and I can honestly say each encounter we had with the staff was not pleasant. I thought maybe the first encounter was just someone having a bad day, but when it kept happening I came to the conclusion that they lacked customer service. In addition if you need to call the front desk they do not answer.\n",

      " Pros; The location can't be beat, near Times Square and Restaurant Row. Hotel was very clean and staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was lacking things I've come to take  for granted like a clock and a coffee maker (or at least a coffee stand  in the lobby) The rooms are small if you have more than one person and there is no dresser or  surface to place clothing other than a small desk area.\n",

They say they will call pest control and are rude during the entire encounter. The front office says they confirmed there is \"activity\" meaning there are bugs BUT they will not tell me what kind of bug.\n",
