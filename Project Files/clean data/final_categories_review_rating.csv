We feel terrible because we had minutes to get to our train and forgot to leave a tip for the hard workers that cleaned our rooms. We will be staying there again when we come back so will be making up for it! The gym was great they even had a skipping rope which I have never seen before so I was very happy. No towels though which was a huge bummer. The tv was very spotty but it was not that big of deal seeing as we didn't spend a lot of time in the room even with our 6 year old. The room was very quiet too. Thank you Melia for making our first trip to New York special and stress free!!!,From minute walked minute left service wa FABULOUS!

There is a lot that the place offers like bikes to go around city but we could not use it.

130,"I stayed at the Innside back in 2019, and I remember having such a wonderful experience. So, when I recently booked my stay (3/20/21) at Innside I wondered if my previous experience was going to be the same this time around. From the second I walked into the hotel,  I was greeted by Whitney and she could not have been more professional and welcoming. She made me feel just like I did when visited almost two years ago. I will be returning to Innside next month, so I am looking forward to my stay and seeing Whitney and the rest of the staff (and eating at Wilson's).

191,This hotel was recommended to us as being in a good location close enough to Times Square but far enough away at the same time and also having all the necessary facilities. And it did. Our bedroom was well enough equipped and not noisy. Wifi worked well throughout the hotel including the bedroom. The shower in the bathroom worked well too. Space in the bathroom was pretty tight. The hotel has a bar diner called Wilsons which is leased out and is very popular but pricey. Front of house staff were excellent as indeed were all of them. Not a huge choice of eating establishments in the area.

226,We were so fortunate to find this great hotel in NYC. Aziz who we first met in our first stay here welcomed us in our second stay as well. He was so nice and welcoming and even upgraded our room so that we do not have to visit empire state as the room has some spectacular views over NYC. Haha!  We stayed a handful of those which struggle to keep up with the ultimate quality of this hotel. Special thanks goes to Aziz and Jojo who welcomed us warmly both times we stayed here. If you are hesitant about finding the perfect place do not any more! P.S. We also highly recommend the hotels own loyalty programme called Hilton Honors.

526,"A few minor issues really ruined the potential of this stay. Although I have status and booked an executive room, I was put into a room that was a total dark cave. The internal room gave no natural light. Sadly, my shower handle was broken and didnâ€™t allow for a hot shower. I informed reception at around 12:30pm and upon my return at 6:30pm, it had not been addressed so I reached back out and was informed that an engineer would come up. I went to dinner and at around 8:30pm, they let me know that they could not fix it and offered to move my room, but because I didnâ€™t plan on being back until late, I had to decline. There were a few redeeming qualities about the room. Frankly it was one of the largest NYC hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and the bed was very comfortable. Having a Kitchenette was very nice and the room was very clean. I would be willing to try again for another stay but hopefully they address the shower before renting the room (1016) again.â€¦","A minor issue really ruined potential stay.

584,"The location was perfect for a wedding we were attending. Loved how close it is to battery park so we could get to the Statue of Liberty and very close to WTC as well.

Housekeeping, and the food service/bussers during breakfast were all very nice. The space worked well with our two kiddos and loved having the full fridge and microwave! The option of a tub to bathe our boys would have been a nice touch. Our view, even on the 16th floor, wasnâ€™t very exciting, but it was dark and quiet at night, which we enjoyed.

We celebrate our sonâ€™t 14th birthday and after a great 3 day stay, we came back to our room to a card and a box of chocolates for him! I also used the gym (that is open 24/7) and the equipment was well maintained and clean. Our breakfast was included and the dinning room was very well organized and with a great selection of foods.","The customer service was excellent! Every employee we had contact with was friendly, polite and helpful. Our breakfast was included and the dinning room was very well organized and with a great selection of foods.",,We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the city and families with kids. Thanks RIU for thisâ€¦

1109,"Spent the weekend at RIU for our first trip out of town since COVID. The hotel had proper signage for COVID safety precautions and the staff wore mask. I only talked to the check in receptionist and the cleaning woman and they were both very friendly.  I love this hotel because of the proximity to Times Square, Riu is only one block away. I've stayed at the Riu 3 times since it first opened. When it first opened of course the rooms were in better shape but they are still nice and clean now. Depending on the room you may have great view of the city. The only minor issue with the room is there was some noticeable water damage above the closet (picture attached) and some of the furniture was starting to wear but it was nothing too bad. I would definitely stay there again.","Spent weekend RIU first trip town since COVID. The hotel proper signage COVID safety precaution staff wore mask.

Hotel employees were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast included was in a box. Fast elevators and the hotel overall was kept clean and safe. Everything we needed was within walking distance including the subway. We will definitely stay here again.","When arrived RIU check wa fast easy.

They offer free breakfast but they closed the service before the limit time even though we were making a line for more than 30 minutes. I read decent reviews before staying there so I was surprise of our bad experience. My recommendation, go to ANY other hotel, not the RIU Plaza Times Square.","Good location decent room.
