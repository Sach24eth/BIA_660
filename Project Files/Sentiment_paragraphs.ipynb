The beds are so comfortable.  The front desk staff is amazing and provides us as much bottled water as we need. The supervisor Kima made sure we were comfortable and gave us an early check in which was so appreciated. The location is great, very easy to get anywhere we want. I would definitely stay here again!\n",

      " I don't usually write reviews, but because of the amazing hospitality we experienced at the Innside NY, a review is definitely warranted! We've stayed at the Innside NY many times and have always had a good experience. On this visit we came to NY due to an emergency. The staff at the Innside NY was so helpful, understanding, empathetic and accommodating, they made our very difficult emergency situation much easier. Zack, Maggie, Cassie, Alexander and Akhlima were all absolutely fabulous! Each of them went above and beyond so that we were able to focus on our emergency situation and not worry about the logistics of our stay. Zack even loaned us his own personal phone charger for the evening. Seeing first hand how caring and hospitable the staff has been at the Innside, I would  not hesitate to recommend the Innside NY, and it will always be our first choice of where to stay when we come to Manhattan.…\n",

      " I was so excited to stay at this hotel because I’ve stayed at Melia hotels several times, including Innside, in other cities and was happy to see they have a NY location.  But since day 1 I have been disappointed in this hotel.  We were charged a hidden resort fee of nearly 50 USD per night which was not included in the total when I made the reservation. The  rooms are unimpressive and lack basic amenities like robes and slippers, as well as hair conditioner. There is just an overall cheap vibe at this hotel that makes you wish you had chosen differently. We had to call several times for better pillows and for housekeeping to remove our dirty dishes which were just ignored during the daily cleaning. Thumbs down. Stay at the Kimpton Eventi instead which is the same price range and much nicer!…\n",

After a meal in Greenwich village we decided to go back to the hotel for drinks rather than walking around looking for places to go as it was cold and raining.  Other than the reception area the only place hotel guests can go (other than their room) is the restaurant/function room.

I was so happy to not have to spend a fortune on lodging as we would be doing other activities in the city as well. More than happy to give glowing reviews of this hotel!\n",

      " My city-view room really had more of a view of the rooftops of the buildings just south of the hotel.  Skyline views south were limited at best.  The hotel was quiet, which is a must in NYC.  There are not a lot of amenities at the hotel, however.  The hotel restaurant (The Wilson) was constantly booked when I was there, with dinners sometimes spilling into the lobby (with their plates of food).  And the restaurant did not appear to be open on Monday or Tuesday.  The room was small, as per usual in NYC, although it did not feel cramped.  There were some technical glitches - several major  broadcast channels on the flat-screen TV were simply bank (NBC, Fox, etc.).  The bathroom shower controls require you tot and in the shower to turn it on - be prepared for a blast of cold…\n",

The hotel lobby is small and has some seating but it is very clean and there is an outside lounge area which was highly utilized and very comfortable.

The air conditioning was adequate. The room has a little mini fridge, which was nice. Everything was clean. The lobby smells amazing- like flowers or something. The restaurant adjacent was delicious, I ate a couple of meals there. Fun little rose garden area in the back too. I would stay here again for sure.\n",

Rooms are quite small but are comfortable.  We had problems the first two days with the cleaning of our room.

We requested more towels for the room and it took over an hour to get them. We left after the first night because we weren’t happy with our stay and service. Two different people gave us different explanations of their cancellation policy, even when the reason we were leaving was the bad customer service and terrible room. Finally the manager spoke with us and said that we would only be charged for the one night we stayed and no other fees would be charged. I just saw my credit card bill with charges and I was definitely charged more than the one night stay. Very dissatisfied with my experience staying in this hotel.\n",

There is a lot that the place offers like bikes to go around city but we could not use it. Maybe next time when it is just me and my Wife. my only gripe would be the 35 $ fee which was a little excessive considering all facilities could not be used and it included wifi use .

Biggest issue was hotel restaurant. It was not open every day and did not serve breakfast (although it was advertised as doing so several places on-line). Restaurant menu was also odd, with several esoteric dishes at the expense of more \"standard\" fare. We mostly ate or drank somewhere else in our 7-day stay. Luckily, for breakfast, Friedman's is a short walk away and is excellent.\n",

In one word: excellent!! It starts with its great location, in the Chelsea area. It continues when you discover you arrived at a new hotel with spacious rooms relative to what is acceptable in Manhattan.  More than anything, it is important to note the good spirit, the kind and dedicated staff (Alex, Kit and Christina whom we have met more than once) make a difference.  In summary a hotel where the corridors are quiet and clean and, in the lobby, and restaurant next door you will always find young people that create a great atmosphere.\n",

The hotel is also very secure with security always present in the lobby and needing your key to access the elevator.

When we couldn’t take the construction one more minute, I went online looking for hotels close to our business. We have driven past almost everyday for years.   When I discovered the hotel online and saw rooms and they had terraces, I was sold. I booked a few nights and the rest is history!  From our first step through the door, we were greeted warmly. The woman (front desk manager at night) was lovely and accommodating and made us feel at ease.   I said to my husband after she checked us in, do you think the hotel will be as nice as she says...

      " Came to NY and stayed here for a weekend back in December with friends. My four friends and I were supposed to have two connecting rooms, but unfortunately, we got stuck with two rooms down the hall from one another. This was not a problem for us, but the hotel was very apologetic and even sent us a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolate. Very nice touch. The rooms here are small (to be expected in NY), but they are very clean and well kept.   What made this hotel ideal for us was its location. It was perfect walking distance from everything we needed to get to. We had a great stay here and we would definitely stay here again.\n",

We didn’t utilize room service or any eatery establishments in the hotel. We would recommended and use again. \n",

      " We stayed in the Double Queen room facing the street. Pros: Room was quiet, clean, beds comfortable, and everything worked. Cons: Room was small, not enough hooks in the bathroom to hang towels, beverage center was useless bc you could only make one size coffee since only the smaller espresso cup could fit under the spout. These are small \"cons,\" but after a few days, they would become annoying. The major negative at this place is the $40 daily service fee. They tell you this will cover all the juice, tea and coffee you would like.  However, they only carry one type of tea and coffee, so if you would like something different, say herbal, you have to go to the restaurant and pay $5 for the tea. Seems that they should carry at least a few extra varieties for the $40 surcharge. My…\n",

Check in was easy and efficient. We found our room to be clean and comfortable- brand new! Quite beautiful. The view from our room as the sun was setting was spectacular!

Second, the hotel itself is fresh out of the press, new to the neighborhood, yet, it is remarkable how well established it feels. -- thanks to its fantastic staff.  Third, the hotel staff was terrific -- Marissa, Alex, Sam -- were extremely helpful in assisting with the stay.  And last but not least, the location -- it is just perfect -- walking distance literally from anything you looking for in New York City, including Broadway.  The total package!

We walked to the hotel from the Port Authority bus station, and it was doable even with small carryon sized suitcases and purses. Even though we got there several hours before check-in time, Monique was able to offer us an available room right away. The room was immediately inviting with a gorgeous city view, modern furnishings, and a comfy bed with plush pillows – perfect to plop down on after a busy day in the city. My name was even written on the TV to welcome me as a personal touch! One of our favorite parts of the room was the full-sized bath and body products that were plant based and had a great relaxing mint scent.

      " My first stay at the Motto was relatively without issue. If it hadn’t rained the first night, it would have been the perfect staycation. The Motto Chelsea is a funky and modern yet no-frills approach to lodging in the big city.   Aside from the wall-mounted suitcase rack just inside the door and hooks on almost every wall for jackets/towels etc. the neatest part of the king bed frame is the cutouts in the bottom to store your extra luggage.   I had a fantastic 30th floor view of the Freedom Tower and even had a little desk nook next to the bed where I was able to take professional Zoom calls when necessary.   The bed was super comfy, the shower was mood-changing, and the room just big enough to not feel like I was staying in a closet, like other rooms I’ve seen in NYC!  …\n",

We could tell from the door, we were going to have a great weekend! Walking in, everyone was so nice!

Our room was 3003 which has an outstanding view of  South of Chelsea including the World Trade Center.

Sandwiched between other tall buildings so no real view for many rooms (and quite open to other properties) if you're not in a king room (please note - triples and double bunks are all on the side of the building that DOES NOT afford a view).

      " We stayed in the New Motto in NYC for one night seeking to have an out of the regular routine day and we are pleased to say that this hotel is excellent,  the staff at the reception were very diligent and very friendly, they fulfilled our expectations we really enjoyed our stay. We were on a 37th floor room, the view to lower Manhattan was breathtaking, even our dog enjoyed the view, the room had everything you'll need, the food in the restaurant was amazing, we even had the pleasure to meet the famous chef Fabio Viviani, the drinks at the bar were also expectacular. We will definitely stay in this hotel again.\n",

The staff is excellent and the lobby/bar is modern and chic.  Aziz, the front desk gentleman provided top-tier service and he’s clearly been in hospitality for a while.   Would gladly stay here again, or just stop by for drink with friends or coworkers.\n",

Every question I had, Hector was able to answer promptly. The hotel has such a warm and inviting  decor with ambient lighting to match. As soon as you walk through the door you are greeted by such an amazing citrus fragrance and  The SMELL IS TO DIE FOR! Thank you to Monique who assisted us when we happened to lose our room key; she made sure to help us out in a New York minute seeing as our Uber was outside waiting on us.

The room itself was sparkling clean, had slippers and luxury shampoo/soaps etc. Mixed metal fixtures, big tv and tons of wall hooks to hang your bags and coats out of the way in the room. The restaurant was lively, delicious and the perfect pre-game to our night at MSG. The host, our waitress Sophia and the rest of the staff of the restaurant & hotel were all so fun and welcoming.

Lovely atmosphere of the restaurant and lounge. Friendly staff and love all the food they serve at the restaurant.  I have busy work schedules, and I need a local getaway, so I also decided to try the hotel and make a reservation with Hector for staying in the hotel, and he arranged my stay at 39floorsr with a beautiful night view of NYC.  Thank you Hector! And kudos for Karry the bartender who makes  delicious drinks. Helpful restaurant managers Baron and Alex  Last but not least, thank you for the chefs Dirk that provided me with the best special hot sauce! ( not on the menu )\n",

At first sight the hotel was obviously in construction mode, finishing up the exterior details such as as the huge glass facade looking into 24th St. ; from the street, you have a clear view of the entirety of the interior - bar and a little of the upcoming restaurant. Upon our check in, we were welcomed by the manager on duty - Hector. He helped us go through the arrival process and even went to lengths in describing room options, pricing and brief introduction of the brand/hotel, to which we are grateful for his patience and hospitality.

Getting a spectacular view is a hit or miss in NYC hotels depending on what part of town you’re in, but at the Motto—my view was phenomenal. (Perfect for tourist, looking to experience a jaw-dropping view.)   Starting with the room—it was fabulous. It was the perfect size: the bed was huge and comfortable and the decor and the art gave the room a luxury feel. Inside of the room, there is a cute seating area for your workspace needs that is connected to the bed and as a professional, I find that feature very necessary.

Check-in with Monique and Johanka was quick and seemless, and they also offer contactless check-in via app. We got a room on the highest floor and the view was just amazing! Rooms are well designed and they offer great amenities. Hotel is in the heart of Chelsea so you have many amazing restaurants and bars in a walking distance. Cant wait to go back!\n",

The rooms are  very clean, with lots of light and with a  modern touch. The bed it's so comfy , didn't want to leave the room😁. This hotel wil be our new place for a gateway with my girls.

Very thoughtful use of space with storage underneath the bed and hanging hooks for your jackets and belongings so you do not forget them. Sustainable bath amenities and the VIEW!!!! Beds are super comfortable. Outside our window the views are priceless NYC skyline views. Service phenomenal - the overnight crew Aziz and Marissa were super welcoming and provided a lot of information about the hotel upon arrival. Alex at the Front Desk was also very hospitable. Jessica the housekeeping manager greeted us with the biggest smile (yes even with the mask you can tell) and provided that Hilton touch. This takes Hilton's hotel game to another level of 21st century. Well done…\n",

Upon arrival, we were greated immediately with enthusiasm and warmth which made us feel comfortable and welcome. I want to specifically mention Aziz at the front desk for his hospitality and eagerness when answering all of our questions. The check in process was very smooth and we were given a room on the 41st floor. The room was incredibly clean and tidy. We had a million dollar view of the World Trade Center, the Hudson River and the entire south end of city. The hotel itself is very close to a ton of attractions as it’s location is in between Chelsea and Flatiron, the heart of the city. I could have not asked for a better stay!\n",

Our room was available when we arrived from the airport around noon which was a pleasant surprise, and we appreciated being able to freshen up before heading out for our first afternoon of sightseeing. The bunk bed set up was ideal for this mom/teenager duo, it gave us each our own space when in the room.

      " Stayed one night 3/16. Great location, very convenient for purpose of my stay. Stayed in room with my own bathroom because I’m not interested in recreating the college dorm experience of using shared bathroom down the hall at my age or having to sleep in bunk beds for a double occupancy. Room is small (typical of NYC hotel) but designed cleverly to make best use of space. I had an issue with tv remote that didn’t work, offered to go down to front desk to swap out remote, front desk said they would send replacement but never did so did not have access to tv. Two minor notes - 1) ice bucket/ice machine not available so if this is important to you, take note. 2) The bed was a mattress on wooden base (no box spring) and very firm so both spouse & I woke up a little stiff, but we are Gen X & used to memory foam & such. Pillows were ok, basic and after some adjusting & folding, I was able to accommodate for my side sleeper position to fall asleep in (but mattress & wooden base made it too firm to stay asleep on side). For me personally, this is fine for a one night stay where I did not spend much time in room, wanted a modern hotel that was conveniently located & budget friendly. But for a lengthier stay, I personally would book a conventional hotel room with amenities like ice machine, coffee machine & in room fridge for my own comfort.   This hotel offers access to free walking tours to local areas like High Line, Central Park, etc., a different walking tour on different days. Details are posted on a sign in the lobby and you can sign up online. This was a unique “perk” that I appreciated even tho I did not have time to partake personally.…\n",

The Pod Times Square was less than $100/night for 2 single bunk beds, a metal chair, and a small clean toilet, sink and shower. The room feels like a sleeper car on a train, or a small cruise ship room. Very compact, not a place to hang out in. (For those who intend to try, each bed has it's own reading light and television, and there are plenty of plugs & USB ports for phones, watches, etc.) There is a safe too, although ours didn't lock properly.  The front desk crew was friendly and welcoming. We were able to get into our room at noon on check in day, which probably won't be typical as tourism picks up in NYC.

Just a small letdown and, as working in tourism for 20 years, it is unacceptable that after 8 days, not a single question if i had a good stay whilst at check out time…..As a repeated and loyal guest I felt sad.

Obviously we knew the room would be pretty small going into it, but it was smaller than we imagined. We were constantly saying \"sorry\" or \"can I slide past you\" when doing anything besides sleeping in the bunks. And lastly, the beds were very uncomfortable. My roommate woke up sore after the first night (and we hadn't even done any walking yet). I understand being a hotel that is not designed for hanging out in the room for long periods of time, but I don't think the mattresses were a place to cut corners.

Thankfully, the rooms are commodious and efficient like in a cruise ship: clean en suite bath; new beds with comfortable mattresses; oversized louvred shutters with great city views.

That made it that much easier to get to key locations including the 911 memorial. The staff was very helpful. Receptionist “Sahar” was very polite and professional. If you are really thinking of visiting NYC and only need a room to rest while to explore the city this is the place to stay. We were in room 1718 and below was our view.

      " We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay at the Pod Times Square!! We chose this hotel for its location not far from Times Square, but for being only a couple blocks to the nearest subway station, with convenience stores, drug store, breakfast options, and restaurants all walkable nearby. We also were attracted to the hotel's offer of discounted parking rates at the garage nearby. Our four nights there were nothing but enjoyable!  Check-in was easy. The staff was friendly and available for any question we had. We enjoyed our view looking east on 42nd Street as well as of the Empire State Building. The hotel was busy, but our floor was quiet. Our room with a double bed was perfect for us. It was still roomy enough...using the storage under the bed for our suitcase and…\n",

Make sure you’re traveling with someone you’re comfortable showering in front of, because the frosted glass bathroom walls means you’ll be showering in front of your roommate.   I found the bed uncomfortably firm. They didn’t need to waste money buying a bed because the floor would’ve been as comfortable.  Overall, though, cleanliness and location give this room a thumbs up from me.\n",

Each bunk had it's own TV and shelf with 2 plugs and USBs (perfect to plug in my CPAP).  The staff was friendly, the concierge was helpful and on checkout, we were able to leave our luggage in storage until 10pm that evening! a perk to allow us a day of sightseeing before heading home.

Wasn't too noisy.  I don't think you can get away from Sirens and Traffic noise until the early hours of the morning anywhere in Manhattan.  Had a small view of the Hudson River.  There were 8 of us all together.  The other rooms - Bunk Pod and Studio Pod were quite small, but you're not really in your room for long when you stay in New York.

      " We had an absolutely amazing stay at Pod Times Square.  Everything was perfect - location, staff, comfort, cleanliness. Would  highly recommend.   We had a lovely surprise when we arrived in our room, we had been upgraded and had balloon and a card wishing us a happy anniversary, this was so kind and thoughtful.   We arrived by bus from Philly and the station was just up the street which was perfect with so much luggage.   Can not recommend a better hotel for a NYC stay. \n",

      " Brilliant location just off Times Square, near subway if needed. Lots of food places nearby. We loved the Galaxy Diner 5 mins away for breakfast. Lovely relaxing place. Good food, good value and good coffee 👍  The hotel is perfectly located. We were a little dazed after a long journey from the UK. Receptionist was brief and cordial. A brief on the lift system might have been useful but a friendly fellow guest helped us with the system. Use room key card to be able to access the floor you need.    The Corridors - very industrial and dark looking slightly horror movie'esq. Got much better in the room.  The Room - great. Clean functional and comfy beds. Frosted glass separates the bed area and bathroom. Not great when sharing with teenage son. The sliding door didn't close either.…\n",

      " Just stayed at the Pod for 5 days for a work trip. Location was excellent to get to the Javits center for a conference. Plenty of dinining options near by; never had a meal at the Polynesian room on the premis, but had a couple of drinks and coffee and pastry in the morning. Room was very clean, nice shower setup and the beds were elevated to allow for storage underneath. There was a little desk to get some work done. One slight annoyance is the two elevator banks you have to take to get to your room; especially when the one to the lobby broke down for a couple days. Three minor cons were no in room coffee, nolotion (I asked at front desk and they did not have any) and just the street noise. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS TOP NOTCH. Asked for an iron, showed up in 5min.

He not only checked us in swiftly but upgraded us to a 2 bedroom “apartment “. Wow!  We were so comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Wellington even remembered us the next day and wanted to make sure that we were enjoying our stay. The hotel is located close to so much and we were able to walk to all of our activities.

Special shout to Jane at the front desk and the rest of the staff, everyone was extremely welcoming and accommodating. The Maiden Lane studio suite was extremely comfortable (much bigger than most NY hotel rooms) and we appreciate the hospitality!!!  Breakfast was excellent and a perfect way to start the day. Our package included parking on 80 Gold Street (5-10 minutes walk and easy in and out). We look forward to another stay in the future!!!\n",

After getting back home, I ordered the exact same blow dryer and the shampoo off of Amazon that was in our hotel room.  The kitchenette, which included pots, pans, dishes, silverware, microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker with coffee, was a bonus for keeping our drinks cold and having a real coffee cup for our hot drinks.  We were right across from the elevator but never heard any sounds after hours.  The restaurant across the street was recommended to us by the hotel staff and it was excellent.  This hotel was also a short walk to the World Trade Center exhibits.  The next time I'm in New York this is where I'm staying the entire time.  I was truly impressed!…\n",

CATHERINE at the front desk was incredibly helpful, resourceful, accommodating and just overall so incredibly warm and welcoming. I stay in NYC hotels but I never am made to feel so welcome... I was compelled to write a review. There also was a gentleman at the front door (didn't catch his name but we conversed and he's half Dominican, half Mexican) and again, the hospitality and warm welcome! The rooms are spacious and clean, and while many parts of Manhattan have recently become a little unsafe (i.e. Times Square area) this hotel is in a part of NYC that is great to explore and safe to walk.

      " I chose this Marriott Residence Inn because of its location to an area of Manhattan we hadn't spent much time in and its proximity to Brooklyn and the ease with which we could visit our daughter there (via subway). It met all of our expectations--a nice size room for NY hotels (executive king studio with sofa bed), a decent complimentary continental breakfast (because of Covid restrictions), free guest laundry (including free detergent and dryer sheets)--and then some. Within 24 hours of our arrival, my husband experienced a minor heart attack while we were in the Upper West Side and was taken to Morningside Mt. Sinai Hospital where he received excellent care. We were only supposed to be in NY for two nights, but the hospitalization forced us to extend our stay. Luckily, he was discharged after 48 hours, but we thought it wise to spend a couple of extra days allowing him to rest up and also take care of any complications should they arise. From the moment I explained our situation, the front desk staff and manager (Annabelle, Jane, Ricki and Petr) could not have been kinder. They maintained our low nightly rate. They showed compassion and kindness with every request or drop by. The housekeeping staff attended to our needs when asked and we have nothing to say but good things about this hotel and its staff. The hotel is also in close proximity to some great local eateries, subways, Battery Park, the Financial District, and the new World Trade Center complex and the 9/11 Museum and Memorial. We definitely plan to stay here again!…\n",

      " Deeply disappointed.   I went out of my way to stay at the Residence Inn Downtown because I love the brand’s relatively large rooms, full kitchens, and included breakfast.   But it was just one problem after another:  - Keycard deactivated without warning during my stay. Twice.  - Made 3 requests for a late checkout before it actually registered to my account  - Without offering or asking, the clerk sent extra bedding to our room just after check-in. Apparently he assumed my same-sex partner would be sleeping on the sofa bed.  - The air conditioner broke  - Some dishes were dirty  - All bathroom tissues were damp, probably because the box was absorbing water from the countertop. This was true on our arrival and still there after the first visit from housekeeing.  - Pandemic breakfast is extremely continental. Cold boiled eggs, bad bagels, kids cereal. We know you have a kitchen back there. Wrap up some warm egg sandwiches like Best Western does.  There are many, many hotels in downtown. I would not recommend this one.…\n",

      " A few minor issues really ruined the potential of this stay. Although I have status and booked an executive room, I was put into a room that was a total dark cave. The internal room gave no natural light. Sadly, my shower handle was broken and didn’t allow for a hot shower. I informed reception at around 12:30pm and upon my return at 6:30pm, it had not been addressed so I reached back out and was informed that an engineer would come up. I went to dinner and at around 8:30pm, they let me know that they could not fix it and offered to move my room, but because I didn’t plan on being back until late, I had to decline. There were a few redeeming qualities about the room. Frankly it was one of the largest NYC hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and the bed was very comfortable. Having a Kitchenette was very nice and the room was very clean. I would be willing to try again for another stay but hopefully they address the shower before renting the room (1016) again.…\n",

Additionally, we bought food at Eataly, and used the dishes, but there was no soap or sponges to clean dishes. Even the dishwasher detergent was not replaced.

The reason why I give this hotel 3 stars out of 5 is because of the   GENERAL MANAGER NAME  “ALEX SPEKTOR” you got our  (gf and me) car towed and lied about it. I did some digging and your mason buddies “nypd” told me the truth.  You called and got our car towed.

Being in the financial district you’re away from the over crowded and tourist ridden area of Times Square. The hotel itself is clean and the staff is accommodating and thoughtful. The rooms are big, especially for a Manhattan hotel. I’ve stayed in others in the past where the rooms were so small the bed consumed the entire space. For price point, room size, amenities, and accommodations, I won’t stay at any other hotel while visiting. 10 stars.\n",

For an adult the mattress on the pullout would have been horrendous (you can feel every spring) but he loved it and reported a great nights sleep.  I would advise asking for the blankets and sheets for the pullout ahead of time- it took about 45mins for them to bring up when we finally thought to ask. And they don’t keep them in the room.

Breakfast is good although it can be alittle bored after staying for a week. Will love to go back again.\n",

Overall, decent hotel - friendly staff, good sized room for NYC, appropriate amenities (internet TV, great bed, room safe, breakfast) - although it seems like it is ‘tired’ and perhaps ready for a refresh.  The location is incredibly convenient to 9/11 Memorial sites, NYSE, Trinity Church, subway stops, shopping, etc... and lots of restaurants in the area.  \n",

      " The location was perfect for a wedding we were attending. Loved how close it is to battery park so we could get to the Statue of Liberty and very close to WTC as well. We had a slight snafu at check in that delayed us getting into our room late at night. However, they corrected it quickly. The staff was really wonderful: the front desk staff, the bell services. Housekeeping, and the food service/bussers during breakfast were all very nice. The space worked well with our two kiddos and loved having the full fridge and microwave! The option of a tub to bathe our boys would have been a nice touch. Our view, even on the 16th floor, wasn’t very exciting, but it was dark and quiet at night, which we enjoyed. \n",

To start with, it is just one block away from the Fulton street station which has plenty of subway lines to get around so easily. The room itself was great, even for just the studio, especially the oven. It was a great way to reheat leftover pizza from Eataly (which I could even see out of my window) in an actual convention oven so it got nice and crisp again. On top of that the staff was great at helping me check-in to my rooms and kept a key for a guest arriving after work for me. They even checked up on me each day to see if I needed anything, specifically Eugy and Danille. Much better than anything in times Square and at an even better price.\n",

The hotel room itself was extremely clean and looks to be very recently renovated.  Our room on the 8th floor had a full-sized refrigerator and microwave, as well as a sink and a dishwasher.

They have an assortment of breakfast options - not your typical basic complimentary breakfast AND had a few snacks for the room.

The breakfast room has lots of Starbucks coffee. They post the busy times for breakfast and they are right-on. It gets very busy after 8am.

The staff also has provided great dining recommendations in walking distance and by cab. The breakfast was probably the only area that I felt could be better. The utensils were not stocked and the food options were minimal in my opinion.  Still nice to have some sort of breakfast included when you have a busy day ahead so we do appreciate that.

The location, though, was outstanding by my priorities: Eataly's downtown location (less of a zoo than Union Square) is barely two blocks away, Century 21is even closer, and there's a Xi'an Famous Food basically around the corner. It was a short walk to the Brooklyn Bridge and an even shorter walk from the ferry from Brooklyn. The Oculus and Fulton Street stations are just a couple of blocks away, so conveniently located for getting anywhere by subway.…\n",

The staff was unparalleled in their service, response time, attentiveness, and just plain friendliness.  The room was spacious, comfortable, and extremely quiet (one of the most quiet NYC hotel rooms I've ever been in.) Breath of fresh air after a day in the city.  The location was wonderful! Found some of my new favorite spots/restaurants in New York just walking around the area.  Whole-heartedly recommend this hotel, you'll be doing yourself a favor by staying here!   Thank you to the Marriott team!\n",

      " Rooms are noticeably bigger than your average New York City mid-range hotel.   Big enough that it didn't bother me to be in an interior room with no view.  I never opened the shades.  (The big bright stylish clock made the room feel less claustrophobic.)  Comfortable bed and lots of desk space made it easy to work. It's a Residence Inn so the rooms also have fridges, microwaves, plates, glasses, and silverware.  Breakfast was quite good as well, definitely a notch up from the standard rubbery eggs and \"sausage product' that you usually get.  Housekeeping service was a little uneven (coffee packets were not replaced; what's the point of having it if it's only for one day?) but very attentive and courteous at check in.

The entrance was a bit hidden due to construction scaffolding, but once I spotted it and took the elevator up to the lobby, it was a smooth checkin process. The lobby staff Genco (Genco was ALWAYS there) and Danielle were fantastic and very attentive throughout my stay. Checkin was fast and I was off to my room to settle in in minutes.

      " 로워 맨하탄을 여행하시는 경우 추천할만한 숙소 입니다. 사우스 페리 10분, 브루클린브릿지 15분, 원 월드원 빌딩 5분 거리에 있습니다. 쇼핑 좋아하시는 분이라면 바로 아랫층 갭 매장과 길 건너 센츄리21 백화점에 꼭 들러보세요. 아침식사는 간단한 빵, 베이글, 스크램블 애그, 채소, 과일, 요거트, 시리얼이 제공됩니다. 무엇보다도 무료로 스타벅스 커피를 마시는 자판기가 설치되어 편리했습니다. 방에 욕조는 없지만 주방 시설이 잘되어 있고 전자렌지와 와인잔이 특히 유용했습니다. 한국인 직원분도 계셔서 친절하게 응대해주셨어요. 다음번에 숙소를 잡는다고 해도 다시 방문하고 싶습니다. 타임스퀘어의 번잡함 보다 훨씬 나은 것 같아요.

      " My family and I have stayed here several times over the past three years, and it continues to shine.  You can’t beat the location: steps to great dining, sightseeing and entertainment options, and the Subway will take you anywhere worth going in the five boroughs.  I am a native New Yorker, now living elsewhere, and this is our home away from home when visiting friends and family in the area.  The rooms are small; welcome to New York.  Having the efficiency kitchen and grocery options nearby allows some flexibility, and you won’t find a bigger room at this price point anyway.  Free breakfast is the usual Residence Inn style, but the room is small so get there early or prepare to be patient.

From the moment we called ahead from the Jersey Turnpike where we were treated kindly and professionally to when we pulled up outside and Sean helped us with parking and directing us upstairs to check -in which was quick and pleasant.  I wish I remembered the very kind lady at the front desk who welcomed us by name as she had anticipated our arrival.  Again, a seamless process. Elevators were lightning fast, the room perfectly sized and suited us beautifully.  Many thanks to the staff and especially to Sean who was a great help to us!\n",

The location was terrific and had very easy access to the subway and walking distance to world trade Centre and Battery Park.   We stayed over New Years Eve and it seemed the hotel was at capacity. The customer service was disinterested to say the least. The most appalling incident was when we phoned down to ask for bed linen for the pullout lounge for the fifth person on our reservation and were told the hotel had run out of blankets and would it be ok for them to give us extra sheets. After telling them this was unacceptable they did eventually find blankets.   The breakfast was chaotic and often basic ingredients were out of stock.

We had a nice view of Fulton Street and we were on a quiet floor ( 6th).  The bed was very comfy and soft--- we had the best sleep-- I couldn't ask for anything better. The bathrooms are nice and stocked with Lemon and Sage toiletries--- the body wash is HEAVEN.  Customer Service is nice especially the breakfast staff very accommodating. I wish there was more breakfast options and more equipment in the gym--- but regardless the hotel is great which is why it still received 5 stars.

Discounted parking at garage across the street. Great experience.   They let us check in to our room at 1:15 on a Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of our King room. It was equipped with microwave, coffee maker, fridge (not mini), stove, and dishwasher. Also stocked with pots, pans, dishes, etc. We weren’t there long enough to cook, but great option for longer stays.   Gym is very nice and the rooftop has lovely seating areas to hang out.

Finally i was told if I needed room service they needed 24 hr notice, I gave them three of those just in case and came back and still nothing was done. The cherry on top when the manager came and was upset at me why i was upset and started bragging about if he punched me I won’t get up!!!

Constant banging because they would clean with the door security lock in place and every time they went into the room which was 20 to 30 times per room you would hear loud banging noises as the door would slam shut.

For proximity to good metro lines and Times Square it is good. The rooms are decent sized and the shower has good water pressure. The breakfast has a huge variety and there is coffee and tea available 24/7. The room could have been a bit cleaner as there were hairs in the drawers which made it feel slightly grimy.  I would recommend this for location but, if walking past homeless people to get into your hotel is a problem for you -you might want to look elsewhere. \n",

I should emphasize all rooms have a fully functioning kitchenette. We upgraded from a normal studio to a one-bedroom, and we feel like we were the King of NY.  We also love the 2nd floor view of the street. In the post-covid era, this is one of the best breakfast buffets I've seen, and the 24-hour coffee/tea is most appreciated. There are two individuals who deserve special recognition. We have some special needs, and Miguel went way above and beyond to meet and exceed our expectations there.

The guest room windows keep all the loud noise of this wonderful city outside and the room quiet and relaxing.  It was also refreshing to visit the 22nd floor roof terrace was privet and clean with many sitting options.  My Florida family will definitely stay here next NYC trip.\n",

The gentleman at the reception told us politely in a distant tone that we had to wait till 4pm, but was gracious enough to put my food items that required refrigeration into the freezer. At about 10 minutes to 4pm  and asked if our room was ready and he said yes. Was wondering why he had to wait for us to ask. He could have just beckoned on us  especially when he knew we were keen to get into the room as early as possible.  Overall, the staff are extremely polite and helpful, but need to make guests a lot morn welcome by looking less stern\n",

We booked this hotel both stays as we had stayed here a few years ago and it was lovely. It was spotless then and very clean. Almost $800 for two nights and our room is not Hilton quality. I travel a lot and expect to clean a hotel room a little when I get there - I usually have to wipe a few things down and I always check for bedbugs. The box spring is torn to shreds as if they had searched with reason and that makes me very nervous. The shades are ripped and tattered. The couch is stained. The furniture is chipped, the trash can which can easily be replaced is falling apart and filthy. The room was very dirty and had splashes and fingerprints everywhere. There was a dirty…\n",

We were given a different story every day of our stay and finally told it was our fault for changing our reservation a week before our stay.  As a result of their incompetence, my 20 yr old son had to spend four nights on the absolute worst sofa “bed” I have ever seen.   Nick, who is apparently their Director of Operations was rude and unprofessional.  In all my years as a Hilton Honors member I have never encountered such treatment.  We travel frequently and are pretty easy going with our accommodations and this Hilton stay was beyond disappointing.

What they can control, however- is the cleanliness of their bathrooms and towels- both of which had many hairs that were definitely and obviously not anyone in our family’s. This led us to be cautious about the cleanliness of the bedding and wondering about other supposed cleaning protocols. Overall- this was a fine stay for a later booking on our end. If you have more time, however, I’d recommend finding a stay further up towards Central Park or in the upper west or east side if you’re with children.\n",

The rooms were clean and had all the amenities needed for my vacation including a fridge, cooktop, microwave, coffeemaker, couch with pull out bed, and a nice clean bathroom  The hotel’s location is near Time Square, which was a bit too busy for my taste (my fault for not checking), but if you’re into this type of touristy accommodations this is the place to stay. Big bonus is that it’s three short blocks away from Penn Station.   Would I stay here again? Yes, definitely would. \n",

      " This hotel has friendly and helpful staff. It is also a very clean hotel room and public area. The room for New york city is a decent size we had a suite with a mid-size refrigerator microwave sink and more. The bed was very comfortable tV was fine. The bathroom was clean and average size, the shower had hot water. The elevators were quick and you could tell which one was coming. They also had a nice rooftop area you could sit and relax. They also had a very good breakfast in a very nice and clean area. They had both hot and cold selections and to-go boxes if you wanted to eat in your room. They had 24-hour coffee and tea and it was hot. If I had to complain about something if would be they had turkey bacon, not regular bacon. I would absolutely stay there again.\n",

The morning buffet breakfast was excellent and varied every day, great way to start the day! We loved that there was an outdoor patio to have breakfast, it made us feel so safe!

Great location, easy to get anywhere in the city by walking or taking the metro which is a block away. The hotel has a gym, a full kitchen in your room, a free breakfast and it does not disappoint - fresh eggs/omelet, steak/turkey sausage, hashbrowns/potatoes, oatmeal, and the normal continental. All the workers are so friendly and greet everyone as they come into the hotel and walk around…\n",

The phone in the room was broken, the electrical socket where the coffee maker was plugged in did not work, there was no iron in the room, our requests to be brought towels and toiletries were forgotten 3 times causing us to eventually have to go down and get it ourselves. We asked for an iron on Friday night and did not receive one until Sunday when we eventually went down and got it ourselves. The ceiling fan in the room was caked in dirt causing my allergies to flare up. For a Hilton property this was very disappointing. Please take better care of your rooms. The property is already not in the best of areas so making sure the rooms are taken care of is a must. \n",

It was a family trip and as such, we got the 2 queen bed rooms on the 18th floor.  Both my husband and my younger son hit their head on those lamps twice.  The only way to avoid it is if they slept further down the bed and moved their pillow away from the headboard.   Definitely something the hotel should look into- as those metal lamps can really hurt!  \n",

      " Stayed for four nights to celebrate 30th birthday. Location was brilliant, very close to main Times Square attractions and close to lots of subway lines to explore the whole city. The hotel itself was clean and rooms were a reasonable size and had all amenities.  Some room for improvement in our opinion, breakfast was very busy, had to queue to get in any time after 8.30am and it crossed where the elevators were so it was mayhem at times. Breakfast was good variety but not big enough area for number of people, it was a shame it let the hotel down.  We also had issues with the service, front of house staff didn't know how to help at times or didn't want to help which we haven't had in USA before as they're usually very welcoming people. Final comments were having tea/coffee available to residents, paying a lot of money to stay but there were no facilities and we had to buy one from the cafe. We also had to pay an extra $21 per night for room cleaning, again for the price why is this not included, or optional, I didn't need room cleaning for a 4 night stay and would rather not pay extra if I had the choice. Hotel has a lot of potential and I would return but wanted to feedback on a few little things that could make it a great place! …\n",

      " Picked this hotel mainly for it's close location to the theaters - great being able to just walk to and from. Rooms were clean. A little on the small size, but I find that quite normal for NYC. Only bad part for us was the free breakfast buffet. Have seen some other reviews stating the food was great - it was not. My daughter quoted that the coffee was the worst coffee she had ever had. The rest of the breakfast buffet was just not good quality to me. We ended up getting breakfast from a few nearby placed during the rest of our stay.\n",

      " Great location, just round the corner from Times Square and all the theatres.  Check in and check our was easy. The held a deposit for damages on my credit card which was cancelled on departure. The rooms are quite small, but as a base it was fine. We are not the type to spend much time in the room so it was fine for us. The rooms were clean and the maid visited every day. The breakfast was great with lots to choose from. We ate in the fashion restaurant each morning instead of the main restaurant as it was smaller with the same food available. The only downside I had, was one morning we had to be out for a tour by 630am meaning we would miss breakfast. The hotel wouldn’t provide us with any breakfast when I enquired. I requested just bakery items like croissants but they wouldn’t help.…\n",

The lifts are quick we never really had to wait for a lift and we managed to stay on the 24th floor which was beautiful!   The breakfast had a lot of variety and as long as you go early you don’t have to queue, the food gets checked and topped up regularly.  Face masks have to be worn at the moment as per their government guidelines.  Our room was fairly spacious and cleaned daily. It was very clean and had everything we needed including a mini fridge, toiletries and  hairdryer.  The staff were all really present and the hotel bar staff are lovely.

My birthday fell on the second day of the trip, I had a happy birthday note and a box of chocolates, it was a lovely touch! Breakfast was a little chaotic due to a member of staff having to check everyone's vaccination status before entering, I'd recommend getting there before 9.30am, otherwise you queue all through the lobby.

The breakfast selection is excellent you are spoilt for choice and over the course of a week can be quite a big saving if you’re on a budget.

      " I've stayed at other RIU's and was excited to stay here with my small family group.  The lobby looks great and is a nice first impression. My check in process was fast and efficient (I checked in online before arriving). The rest of my party took awhile to get set up.  We all received early check-in, which was appreciated after a redeye flight.  The 8th floor looked like a hospital hallway.  Room 822 was very small. My pet peeve is cleanliness (or lack up). I found hairs everywhere and asked for a new room.  The new room was better, bigger. Again, cleanliness. My daughter and I prepare for bed and I see specks of BLOOD stains on the inside of the sheets. My husband called down and someone promptly changed the linen.\n",

My only constructive comments would be for the hotel to provide say one or two pages of paper with opening times on it for breakfast, pointing guests to their restaurant, explaining more about the internet, and perhaps a local map pointing out some places to see. Yes I know they provide the typical Rui magazine, but something more personal would be great.

The location of the hotel is excellent and the room was clean with a nice view. We were also offered a late check-out (an extra hour) at no extra charge which was very helpful.  The staff were very kind and polite especially the breakfast team.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed with everything else. The rooms do not come with a duvet but a thin blanket in sheets. As we stayed in December we were extremely cold and sadly the heating system is not great. Took a long time to warm up and still was not quite warm enough.

      " This hotel is in the perfect location for Times Square and the theatre district.  The views across the city from floor 28 are stunning.  However, it lacks in quite a few areas.  The rooms were clean but had no tea or coffee making facilities and for such a highly rated hotel this was disappointing.  This may not have been an issue were it not for the breakfast situation.  Gasping for tea we eagerly made our way to breakfast on the first morning to find ourselves battling out of the lift as the queue for the restaurant is ridiculously located blocking the lifts.  Patiently joining the end of the queue it seemed to move quickly so my hope of tea wasn’t out of reach (I’m British and we need tea).

After being stuck in an elevator for over an hour, having to get rescued by the FDNY (who had to get us out from the top of the elevator) not one member of staff was there to ask us even if we were okay or offered us a glass of water!  A few days later at 9pm the fire alarms went off and the hotel evacuated because a member of staff had thrown a cigarette in the large hotel garbage causing a fire.

Noises from the corridor were also disturbing. I believe most of the rooms suffer from this problem. Then check in process was a nightmare. I arrived at 11am. Waited all the line just to learn that check in starts at 4pm and they charge $50 for earlu check in. This is crzy. I understand that you will be charged if you want to pre book an early check in, but when you arrive - if there is no room, it's one thing, but if there is room - why not give the room for free? A week earlier at the Westin I got a room at 6am(and it was a very quiet room)! Then when I told the receptionist the next day that I had a horrible…\n",

The only downfall, as others mentioned is the awkward bathroom situation. The “wall” between the bathroom and the room is frosted glass right in the shower. You can see an outline of the showering person and there is no soundproofing so you can hear all bathroom sounds. Beds are comfy. Ask for a high floor when reserving. We were on floor 23 and it was quiet.\n",

First, it was safe and clean and the location was PERFECT.  It is literally 1 block from the Theatre District AND from the double-decker tour pick-up bus stop that I went on Top View.  The one thing I will say to new check-ins is that you need to use one of the room's card keys to insert into the lightbox AFTER you enter your hotel room and this will allow the lights to stay on.  Aside from that, I was very happy with my stay here.   I like that you need a card key to use the elevator.

      " Quick check in friendly staff.  Wake up sooner the better to access elevators gym showers & Buffett less people early morning. I say gym showers cause the showers in room are a silhouette you can see your shadow so if you want privacy best to use them.  I had to turn the lights off in room to shower though the shower head was great shampoo body wash smelled good.  The power is turned on with your room key left inserted.  The free breakfast Buffett I did not like only went once best thing I ate was the fresh fruit.  Eggs were runny watery bacon not cooked thoroughly left greasy labeled pinto beans tasted like something else turn off for me.  They do have a small cafe attached to the side of hotel very pricey!   Small refrigerator in room no microwave.\n",

      " All staff was very friendly and accommodating. Lots of elevators and they were very fast. All areas of the hotel were very clean. Breakfast buffet had lots of selections and food was very good. The line for the buffet was very long...went down to the gym...but moved quickly - about a 20 minute wait from the gym.  The rooms had lots of outlets and USB ports. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Two adults and two kids were comfortable in a 2 bed room. Four adults may be a little tight.  Great location with lots of retail and restaurants. No complaints, would definitely stay again.\n",

      " The hotel is beautiful and in a good location.  That’s about all it has going for it.   You have to specifically request for your room to be cleaned. We did 3 days with nothing. We ran out of towels. When we asked the first housekeeper, she told us no. Finally, we saw another housekeeper who gave us some. We ran out of towels and toilet paper because our room was never cleaned and had to call down to get them.   The Fashion Restaurant for dinner is the pits. Their menu is very limited. We got a pasta with pesto and it was greasy and just bad. Next to our table was a TV. That was also where the staff had plugged in their cell phones. Every few minutes, someone would come to check their phone! They were very slow so apparently they had nothing to do.   They have a nice patio area.…\n",

      " Our stay was 5 nights on 15th floor.  Hotel and room was spotless.  Just steps from Times Square.  Tons of restaurants in walking distance.  Staff was helpful and friendly.   Asked for two things and they were delivered within minutes.  Breakfast was in boxes due to covid but was just fine.  Eggs, pancake, sausage, bacon and hash browns with juice/coffee and you could add cereal, fruit or yogurt.  Dunkin Donuts is also across the street.  Room cleaning is only upon request.  Lobby and seating area was always clean.   Masks required in hotel and most inside spots.   A few great restaurants we visited in walking distance:  Mercury Bar, Meatball, Pint Bar.   So many things to do but my favorite was Top of the Rock.  Beautiful view of the city.   Next visit I will book it for…\n",

      " Spent the weekend at RIU for our first trip out of town since COVID. The hotel had proper signage for COVID safety precautions and the staff wore mask. I only talked to the check in receptionist and the cleaning woman and they were both very friendly.  I love this hotel because of the proximity to Times Square, Riu is only one block away. I've stayed at the Riu 3 times since it first opened. When it first opened of course the rooms were in better shape but they are still nice and clean now. Depending on the room you may have great view of the city. The only minor issue with the room is there was some noticeable water damage above the closet (picture attached) and some of the furniture was starting to wear but it was nothing too bad. I would definitely stay there again.\n",

Hotel employees were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast included was in a box. Fast elevators and the hotel overall was kept clean and safe. Everything we needed was within walking distance including the subway. We will definitely stay here again.\n",

      " we were in June, we were of moon honey and in general I have a good remember. The staff were kindy and if you don't speak english or no much , fastly they looked for person that speaking spanish. The rooms maybe was small, but as you only sleep in there you didn`t need much space. The location is perfect, it is near the times square, underground, brodway...for my the loaction are one of the  best. The price maybe are some expensive, but if you want to be in the center you must paid it. We didn´t eat  in the restaurant, only had a breakfast, and in my opinion were really expensive, if you walked 1 o 2 street  more, you can take the same more cheap.\n",

They offer free breakfast but they closed the service before the limit time even though we were making a line for more than 30 minutes.

The  rooms are unimpressive and lack basic amenities like robes and slippers, as well as hair conditioner. There is just an overall cheap vibe at this hotel that makes you wish you had chosen differently. We had to call several times for better pillows and for housekeeping to remove our dirty dishes which were just ignored during the daily cleaning. Thumbs down.

Alex was amazing at check in and his recommendations for dinner were \"great\" The Hotel is in a great location and a modern vibe/design. Common areas are clean but I can't say the same for the room.

      "My friends & I had a great stay at Innside NYC. The hotel was super modern, clean & in close proximity to a ton of cool restaurants & bars. Our check in with Kimberly was seamless (much appreciated after a long ride from Boston). The view from our room on the 19th floor was amazing. The room could have been a tad bigger for the price, but the style & design more than made up for that. The Wilson (restaurant w/in the hotel) was great. The outdoor seating area in the back was gorgeous. Our server Esteban was excellent. Only complaint-kitchen closed @9:30… I thought this was the city that never sleeps? Check out was also great (minus the “resort fees”). Alex , Ridge & Christina were very kind & more than happy to store our 15 bags while we spent some time enjoying the city after…\n",

Location was perfect to walk too 5th avenue, Chelsea Market and the High Line.  Loved the restaurant The Wilson and our friendly bartender Neema. Food was great and so was the wine!  This hotel would be a great consideration for a small NYC meeting at a very reasonable price point.  I highly suggest and will return again soon.  And thank you Alexandra! :)\n",

One night we spent time at the restaurant and bar where Baron, Isiah, Marco, and a few other staff members served us and gave us 5 star service. They were all entirely friendly and kind! The general manager, Bassim, made for great experience and was very pleasant. I would 100% recommend this hotel, great location, great vibe, and a spectacular team! Thank you for a fantastic stay, we will definitely be back!!\n",

The room was well organize with a small “office space”. Quiet most of the time, you can barely hear NYC sounds (ambulance, FDNY or NYPD sirens). Their staff is nice and helpful. I would like to thank the two managers that made our stay extra special Travis and Alex and the girsl at the coffeeshop in the morning Stephanie and Taniaa, they were amazing and  made my breakfast extra fun!!  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner at Bar Cicchetti. All the food i tried was delicious.  Fitness centrr available and Rooftop opening on the second floor soon.  Definitely a place i will recommend to friends, family and clients.…\n",

Hector was such great help when he realized my stay wasn’t the correct amount of nights I needed but didn’t hesitate to fix it for me. Was also convenient that the bar had extra bottle openers to give me to open some drinks I had in my room. Stayed on the 22nd floor with gorgeous views and was a good size for an NYC hotel. Bed was super comfy and bathroom was amazing considering someone could use the sink while someone is showering. Located in midtown not too far from the flatiron building and is surrounded by lots of great eats and places to shop too!

It was definitely a much needed and well worth it stay. There was so much to do right within the hotel but you are in prime location within walking distance to wherever your heart desires.

Our room was available when we arrived from the airport around noon which was a pleasant surprise, and we appreciated being able to freshen up before heading out for our first afternoon of sightseeing.

      "Stayed one night 3/16. Great location, very convenient for purpose of my stay. Stayed in room with my own bathroom because I’m not interested in recreating the college dorm experience of using shared bathroom down the hall at my age or having to sleep in bunk beds for a double occupancy. Room is small (typical of NYC hotel) but designed cleverly to make best use of space. I had an issue with tv remote that didn’t work, offered to go down to front desk to swap out remote, front desk said they would send replacement but never did so did not have access to tv. Two minor notes - 1) ice bucket/ice machine not available so if this is important to you, take note. 2) The bed was a mattress on wooden base (no box spring) and very firm so both spouse & I woke up a little stiff, but we are Gen X & used to memory foam & such. Pillows were ok, basic and after some adjusting & folding, I was able to accommodate for my side sleeper position to fall asleep in (but mattress & wooden base made it too firm to stay asleep on side). For me personally, this is fine for a one night stay where I did not spend much time in room, wanted a modern hotel that was conveniently located & budget friendly. But for a lengthier stay, I personally would book a conventional hotel room with amenities like ice machine, coffee machine & in room fridge for my own comfort.   This hotel offers access to free walking tours to local areas like High Line, Central Park, etc., a different walking tour on different days. Details are posted on a sign in the lobby and you can sign up online. This was a unique “perk” that I appreciated even tho I did not have time to partake personally.…\n",

It had all the necessities, flat screen tv many channels, nice hot water and bed was comfortable  The location of  this POD is conveniently located near important site seeing locations and most importantly the  NYC subway system. That made it that much easier to get to key locations including the 911 memorial. The staff was very helpful. Receptionist “Sahar” was very polite and professional. If you are really thinking of visiting NYC and only need a room to rest while to explore the city this is the place to stay. We were in room 1718 and below was our view. I would highly recommend this place for friends…\n",

Good food, good value and good coffee 👍  The hotel is perfectly located. We were a little dazed after a long journey from the UK. Receptionist was brief and cordial. A brief on the lift system might have been useful but a friendly fellow guest helped us with the system. Use room key card to be able to access the floor you need.    The Corridors - very industrial and dark looking slightly horror movie'esq. Got much better in the room.  The Room - great. Clean functional and comfy beds. Frosted glass separates the bed area and bathroom. Not great when sharing with teenage son. The sliding door didn't close either.…\n",

Special shout to Jane at the front desk and the rest of the staff, everyone was extremely welcoming and accommodating. The Maiden Lane studio suite was extremely comfortable (much bigger than most NY hotel rooms) and we appreciate the hospitality!!!  Breakfast was excellent and a perfect way to start the day.

It met all of our expectations--a nice size room for NY hotels (executive king studio with sofa bed), a decent complimentary continental breakfast (because of Covid restrictions), free guest laundry (including free detergent and dryer sheets)--and then some. Within 24 hours of our arrival, my husband experienced a minor heart attack while we were in the Upper West Side and was taken to Morningside Mt. Sinai Hospital where he received excellent care. We were only supposed to be in NY for two nights, but the hospitalization forced us to extend our stay. Luckily, he was discharged after 48 hours, but we thought it wise to spend a couple of extra days allowing him to rest up and also take care of any complications should they arise. From the moment I explained our situation, the front desk staff and manager (Annabelle, Jane, Ricki and Petr) could not have been kinder. They maintained our low nightly rate. They showed compassion and kindness with every request or drop by. The housekeeping staff attended to our needs when asked and we have nothing to say but good things about this hotel and its staff. The hotel is also in close proximity to some great local eateries, subways, Battery Park, the Financial District, and the new World Trade Center complex and the 9/11 Museum and Memorial. We definitely plan to stay here again!…\n",

      "What an amazing hospitable stay. From the moment we checked in Annabelle was there to assist us, personable, professional and friendly. We booked here because of the king size bed, the room was clean comfortable and larger than most downtown locations. The breakfast area was bustling in the morning, but the options were abundant and the company was great, there was a lot of group seating, as well as Starbucks coffee machines. Ricky, who works in the breakfast room is a breath of fresh air, what a happy spirit with a zest for life and a keen sense of guest service. I look forward to my next stay, downtown, close to WTC shops and restaurants without the evening crowds.

Hotel is located very close to Times Square.   But didn't hear too much noise. We were on 11th floor overlooking the market area. Room was plenty big enough for us and bonus with no charge for safe. Bed was large and comfy, TV was fine although a radio /music station would have suited us more. Shower was powerful and I can see how the bathroom wall could be an issue if staying with friends.  Breakfast was included and we definitely didn't starve! From fruit, yoghurt, bread, pastries, pancakes, waffles, hot food as well as juice, tea & coffee. We didn't have to que at all but our body clocks were very mixed up and we were down there when it opened.   We ate in hotel restaurant, which we felt was decent value for money.

We celebrate our son’t 14th birthday and after a great 3 day stay, we came back to our room to a card and a box of chocolates for him!

      "Stayed here for 3 days during a visit to NYC. This was my 9th visit to NYC but first time staying at this hotel.  First impressions of hotel were good, very nice modern lobby area with a nice bar in the lobby area also. Location is excellent as very close to Times Square. However, once we exited the elevator on our floor the hotel decor had a very clinical feel about it, especially the hallways.   Bedroom was decent size compared to other NYC hotels I’ve stayed in and quite modern but again had a clinical feel about it. Beds moved around floor quite easily when getting into the bed or moving around. Other than that, beds were very comfortable.   I was very surprised that there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room. This is the first hotel that I have ever stayed in that did…\n",

      "The staff is what ruined my stay at this hotel.  My family stayed 5 nights and I can honestly say each encounter we had with the staff was not pleasant.  They made us feel not welcomed or wanted.  I thought maybe the first encounter was just someone having a bad day, but when it kept happening I came to the conclusion that they lacked customer service.

Eggs, pancake, sausage, bacon and hash browns with juice/coffee and you could add cereal, fruit or yogurt.  Dunkin Donuts is also across the street.  Room cleaning is only upon request.  Lobby and seating area was always clean.   Masks required in hotel and most inside spots.   A few great restaurants we visited in walking distance:  Mercury Bar, Meatball, Pint Bar.   So many things to do but my favorite was Top of the Rock.  Beautiful view of the city.   Next visit I will book it for…\n",

      "Spent the weekend at RIU for our first trip out of town since COVID. The hotel had proper signage for COVID safety precautions and the staff wore mask. I only talked to the check in receptionist and the cleaning woman and they were both very friendly.  I love this hotel because of the proximity to Times Square, Riu is only one block away. I've stayed at the Riu 3 times since it first opened. When it first opened of course the rooms were in better shape but they are still nice and clean now. Depending on the room you may have great view of the city. The only minor issue with the room is there was some noticeable water damage above the closet (picture attached) and some of the furniture was starting to wear but it was nothing too bad. I would definitely stay there again.\n",

The location is perfect, it is near the times square, underground, brodway...for my the loaction are one of the  best. The price maybe are some expensive, but if you want to be in the center you must paid it.
