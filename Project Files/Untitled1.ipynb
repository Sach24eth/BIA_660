      "We stayed in a family loft which is two connecting rooms, one with a king and one with 2 doubles. Each has a bathroom. So perfect for our family of 5! The hotel and our room is very clean. The beds are so comfortable.  The front desk staff is amazing and provides us as much bottled water as we need. The supervisor Kima made sure we were comfortable and gave us an early check in which was so appreciated. The location is great, very easy to get anywhere we want. I would definitely stay here again!\n",

We've stayed at the Innside NY many times and have always had a good experience. On this visit we came to NY due to an emergency. The staff at the Innside NY was so helpful, understanding, empathetic and accommodating, they made our very difficult emergency situation much easier. Zack, Maggie, Cassie, Alexander and Akhlima were all absolutely fabulous! Each of them went above and beyond so that we were able to focus on our emergency situation and not worry about the logistics of our stay. Zack even loaned us his own personal phone charger for the evening. Seeing first hand how caring and hospitable the staff has been at the Innside, I would  not hesitate to recommend the Innside NY, and it will always be our first choice of where to stay when we come to Manhattan.…\n",

      "I was so excited to stay at this hotel because I’ve stayed at Melia hotels several times, including Innside, in other cities and was happy to see they have a NY location.  But since day 1 I have been disappointed in this hotel.  We were charged a hidden resort fee of nearly 50 USD per night which was not included in the total when I made the reservation. The  rooms are unimpressive and lack basic amenities like robes and slippers, as well as hair conditioner. There is just an overall cheap vibe at this hotel that makes you wish you had chosen differently. We had to call several times for better pillows and for housekeeping to remove our dirty dishes which were just ignored during the daily cleaning. Thumbs down. Stay at the Kimpton Eventi instead which is the same price range and much nicer!…\n",

More than anything, it is important to note the good spirit, the kind and dedicated staff (Alex, Kit and Christina whom we have met more than once) make a difference.  In summary a hotel where the corridors are quiet and clean and, in the lobby, and restaurant next door you will always find young people that create a great atmosphere.\n",

Our check-in experience was flawless, the rooms were clean and well-designed, the location was central, and the gym on the 20th floor was fantastic.

Location is actually really convenient if you're trying to go to Times Square, Highline, Chelsea Market, Or Flatiron. It actually wasn't even that tough of a walk to NoHo. There are plenty of markets close by for any items you may need.  Hotel staff was excellent and very receptive and responsive especially Ridge, Kit and Whitney. They were always very welcoming, very nice and always seemed to have energy!  Thanks you three and the rest of the INNside staff for a wonderful stay!\n",

The staff was very cold, not friendly, and made it seem like dealing with a guest had to be completed in 60 seconds or less. No hellos, no good mornings, no good evenings, no recommendations, nothing.   The rooms were comfortable, but small as is expected in NYC. The shower and sheets were the only places we didn't think were super clean, there was three broken tiles in the shower with dirty grout, dust/dirt in the corners, etc. A few random hairs on sheets/pillows at check-in. The floor, windows, etc seemed clean otherwise.   The views are great, the area is safe. If you're chill and don't need much, this is…\n",

The Nomad is a beautiful hotel located in the flower district just a very short walk to Penn Station.  The hotel is impeccably clean.  It feels cleaner than a hospital and one has no doubt that they take cleanliness very seriously.  The hotel is also very secure with security always present in the lobby and needing your key to access the elevator.  The rooms themselves are very modern and large with lots of space to store your things.  I stayed in a king room alone but this room could easily accommodate a couple for a week long trip or more.

Check in was easy and efficient. We found our room to be clean and comfortable- brand new! Quite beautiful. The view from our room as the sun was setting was spectacular!

Clean, well-designed micro-studio with breathtaking views in the heart of new york, for the price point where I felt comfortable extending the stay without breaking my bank account. Cheers.  Second, the hotel itself is fresh out of the press, new to the neighborhood, yet, it is remarkable how well established it feels. -- thanks to its fantastic staff.  Third, the hotel staff was terrific -- Marissa, Alex, Sam -- were extremely helpful in assisting with the stay.  And last but not least, the location -- it is just perfect -- walking distance literally from anything you looking for in New York City, including Broadway.  The total package!

My name was even written on the TV to welcome me as a personal touch!

Plenty of room for my daughter and I. Again, the details were amazing and it was just a bright and cozy environment. This was my first time in New York and this place was setting the stage perfectly. We stayed for 3 nights. All was great on the first 2 nights. We were on the 24th floor which is way higher than any room I’ve stayed in before. The view of the city was perfect.

      "The Motto Hotel was an amazing stay in Chelsea. We were there for a quick getaway. The entry into the hotel is very modern with clean lines and gray hues. The ambiance and decor upon arriving at the front desk is very warm and welcoming with an amber undertone. Check in was quick and efficient. Our room was 3003 which has an outstanding view of  South of Chelsea including the World Trade Center. The size of the room is comparable to a Miami boutique size with plenty of modern amenities and a unique use of space. The staff was kind and friendly. Overall I’d stay there again.\n",

The front desk staff were super friendly. Highly recommend!\n",

High end finishes throughout and nicely designed with lots of jewel tones and glass. (Although less than two months from opening, tiles already missing in the bathroom in the room we stayed in.) Sandwiched between other tall buildings so no real view for many rooms (and quite open to other properties) if you're not in a king room (please note - triples and double bunks are all on the side of the building that DOES NOT afford a view). Lovely lobby and bar/restaurant area with coffee/bakery service (although hours did not include late evening which was inconvenient). One of the most striking…\n",

My partner and I enjoyed amenities such as the communal lounge to get some work done, to the in-house gym, to the restaurant as well as the bar. It was definitely a much needed and well worth it stay. There was so much to do right within the hotel but you are in prime location within walking distance to wherever your heart desires.

      "We came upon this new hotel as we were driving along 6th avenue trying to find a parking space on a lazy Sunday and eventually decided to stay for the evening. At first sight the hotel was obviously in construction mode, finishing up the exterior details such as as the huge glass facade looking into 24th St. ; from the street, you have a clear view of the entirety of the interior - bar and a little of the upcoming restaurant. Upon our check in, we were welcomed by the manager on duty - Hector. He helped us go through the arrival process and even went to lengths in describing room options, pricing and brief introduction of the brand/hotel, to which we are grateful for his patience and hospitality. We decided to go for a room with 2 beds (full size) - little did we know Hector…\n",

Getting a spectacular view is a hit or miss in NYC hotels depending on what part of town you’re in, but at the Motto—my view was phenomenal. (Perfect for tourist, looking to experience a jaw-dropping view.)   Starting with the room—it was fabulous. It was the perfect size: the bed was huge and comfortable and the decor and the art gave the room a luxury feel. Inside of the room, there is a cute seating area for your workspace needs that is connected to the bed and as a professional, I find that feature very necessary.

      "Stayed one night 3/16. Great location, very convenient for purpose of my stay. Stayed in room with my own bathroom because I’m not interested in recreating the college dorm experience of using shared bathroom down the hall at my age or having to sleep in bunk beds for a double occupancy. Room is small (typical of NYC hotel) but designed cleverly to make best use of space. I had an issue with tv remote that didn’t work, offered to go down to front desk to swap out remote, front desk said they would send replacement but never did so did not have access to tv. Two minor notes - 1) ice bucket/ice machine not available so if this is important to you, take note. 2) The bed was a mattress on wooden base (no box spring) and very firm so both spouse & I woke up a little stiff, but we are Gen X & used to memory foam & such. Pillows were ok, basic and after some adjusting & folding, I was able to accommodate for my side sleeper position to fall asleep in (but mattress & wooden base made it too firm to stay asleep on side). For me personally, this is fine for a one night stay where I did not spend much time in room, wanted a modern hotel that was conveniently located & budget friendly. But for a lengthier stay, I personally would book a conventional hotel room with amenities like ice machine, coffee machine & in room fridge for my own comfort.   This hotel offers access to free walking tours to local areas like High Line, Central Park, etc., a different walking tour on different days. Details are posted on a sign in the lobby and you can sign up online. This was a unique “perk” that I appreciated even tho I did not have time to partake personally.…\n",

The room feels like a sleeper car on a train, or a small cruise ship room. Very compact, not a place to hang out in.

Obviously we knew the room would be pretty small going into it, but it was smaller than we imagined. We were constantly saying \"sorry\" or \"can I slide past you\" when doing anything besides sleeping in the bunks. And lastly, the beds were very uncomfortable. My roommate woke up sore after the first night (and we hadn't even done any walking yet). I understand being a hotel that is not designed for hanging out in the room for long periods of time, but I don't think the mattresses were a place to cut corners. You want to be able to get a good night's sleep after a long day spent traipsing…\n",

One person at the front desk was very sorry when I called and said he would make sure the room was cleaned the next day. It was not cleaned and the next person I talked to didn't seem to care.\n",

The rooms are small as expected but there was enough room for us with 2 suitcase and 2 hand luggage cases in there.

As you can imagine, during this particular time of the year, Times Square is more busy than usual. The New Year was about to start on an ill note after realizing an error made, on my part, for my reservation. Thankfully, the team at the front desk, specifically Kathy, was able to alleviate my anxiety and accommodate me as needed. Kathy handled my ordeal promptly and with an infectious smile. In no time, I was on my way to unpacking and joining the planned festivities for the New Year.

      "I chose this Marriott Residence Inn because of its location to an area of Manhattan we hadn't spent much time in and its proximity to Brooklyn and the ease with which we could visit our daughter there (via subway). It met all of our expectations--a nice size room for NY hotels (executive king studio with sofa bed), a decent complimentary continental breakfast (because of Covid restrictions), free guest laundry (including free detergent and dryer sheets)--and then some. Within 24 hours of our arrival, my husband experienced a minor heart attack while we were in the Upper West Side and was taken to Morningside Mt. Sinai Hospital where he received excellent care. We were only supposed to be in NY for two nights, but the hospitalization forced us to extend our stay. Luckily, he was discharged after 48 hours, but we thought it wise to spend a couple of extra days allowing him to rest up and also take care of any complications should they arise. From the moment I explained our situation, the front desk staff and manager (Annabelle, Jane, Ricki and Petr) could not have been kinder. They maintained our low nightly rate. They showed compassion and kindness with every request or drop by. The housekeeping staff attended to our needs when asked and we have nothing to say but good things about this hotel and its staff. The hotel is also in close proximity to some great local eateries, subways, Battery Park, the Financial District, and the new World Trade Center complex and the 9/11 Museum and Memorial. We definitely plan to stay here again!…\n",

But it was just one problem after another:  - Keycard deactivated without warning during my stay. Twice.  - Made 3 requests for a late checkout before it actually registered to my account  - Without offering or asking, the clerk sent extra bedding to our room just after check-in. Apparently he assumed my same-sex partner would be sleeping on the sofa bed.  - The air conditioner broke  - Some dishes were dirty  - All bathroom tissues were damp, probably because the box was absorbing water from the countertop. This was true on our arrival and still there after the first visit from housekeeing.  - Pandemic breakfast is extremely continental. Cold boiled eggs, bad bagels, kids cereal. We know you have a kitchen back there. Wrap up some warm egg sandwiches like Best Western does.  There are many, many hotels in downtown. I would not recommend this one.…\n",

The internal room gave no natural light. Sadly, my shower handle was broken and didn’t allow for a hot shower. I informed reception at around 12:30pm and upon my return at 6:30pm, it had not been addressed so I reached back out and was informed that an engineer would come up. I went to dinner and at around 8:30pm, they let me know that they could not fix it and offered to move my room, but because I didn’t plan on being back until late, I had to decline. There were a few redeeming qualities about the room. Frankly it was one of the largest NYC hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and the bed was very comfortable. Having a Kitchenette was very nice and the room was very clean. I would be willing to try again for another stay but hopefully they address the shower before renting the room (1016) again.…\n",

The reason why I give this hotel 3 stars out of 5 is because of the   GENERAL MANAGER NAME  “ALEX SPEKTOR” you got our  (gf and me) car towed and lied about it.

Being in the financial district you’re away from the over crowded and tourist ridden area of Times Square. The hotel itself is clean and the staff is accommodating and thoughtful. The rooms are big, especially for a Manhattan hotel. I’ve stayed in others in the past where the rooms were so small the bed consumed the entire space. For price point, room size, amenities, and accommodations, I won’t stay at any other hotel while visiting. 10 stars.\n",

Unfortunately for us, it was bitterly cold so we didn't want to walk too far for dinner. Michael at the front desk recommended The Malt House across the street and it was amazing! The 911 Museum was just up the street. If you've haven't been, it's a must. There is so much to do in the general vicinity, that one night doesn't seem long enough. We can't wait to go back again in the spring so we can walk around and take it all in!\n",

After all taxes/fees, we avg $265/night for an upgraded “clean air” room which I did think the air was cleaner than your avg hotel room, basic but nice staff, large rooms (for NYC), good gym, on-site laundry ($7 per load), free breakfast, kitchens in room, free wifi, free snacks/water ($15/day), I think this is a great value and I would certainly stay here again.

This hotel not only is it located in the best spot but the service here is top notch. Plus break fast included? Say whaaaaaat? During breakfast Felix and Ana always said good morning and we’re so attentive to make sure everyone had what they wanted/needed for breakfast. The front desk provided all information needed to get around the hotel and make sure if we needed anything in our room to let them know. We received clean towels everyday. The hotel room was sparkling clean and such an amazing layout. If you are coming for more than 4 days the room includes everything you need to cook a nice meal to save some money.

For reference I often stay in the lower east side and there I appreciate the chaos and blending of cultures. On this street it wasn't 'interesting' it was 'nasty'.  Ok bad stuff out of the way. On to the good stuff and there is plenty.  Food delivery - very much sorted…\n",

We also had issues with the service, front of house staff didn't know how to help at times or didn't want to help which we haven't had in USA before as they're usually very welcoming people. Final comments were having tea/coffee available to residents, paying a lot of money to stay but there were no facilities and we had to buy one from the cafe. We also had to pay an extra $21 per night for room cleaning, again for the price why is this not included, or optional, I didn't need room cleaning for a 4 night stay and would rather not pay extra if I had the choice.

My daughter quoted that the coffee was the worst coffee she had ever had. The rest of the breakfast buffet was just not good quality to me.

You can store your luggage with the concierge service. While the lobby is beautiful, the floors and rooms are mediocre. The room is average- it is tight- 2 beds and a sofa bed with a place for sitting and table makes it pretty much impossible to move around too much. When you open the sofa bed you can’t open the fridge anymore. It’s a bare essentials kinda situation.  I guess when you’re in NYC you’re not going…\n",

Just one slight criticism was that there are no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms so would advise taking a travel kettle, although there is a full size fridge and they give you bottled water daily.  Staff very nice throughout the Hotel, would definitely stay there again.\n"

Noises from the corridor were also disturbing. I believe most of the rooms suffer from this problem. Then check in process was a nightmare. I arrived at 11am. Waited all the line just to learn that check in starts at 4pm and they charge $50 for earlu check in. This is crzy. I understand that you will be charged if you want to pre book an early check in, but when you arrive - if there is no room, it's one thing, but if there is room - why not give the room for free?

Hotel employees were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast included was in a box. Fast elevators and the hotel overall was kept clean and safe. Everything we needed was within walking distance including the subway. We will definitely stay here again.\n",

      "we were in June, we were of moon honey and in general I have a good remember. The staff were kindy and if you don't speak english or no much , fastly they looked for person that speaking spanish. The rooms maybe was small, but as you only sleep in there you didn`t need much space. The location is perfect, it is near the times square, underground, brodway...for my the loaction are one of the  best. The price maybe are some expensive, but if you want to be in the center you must paid it. We didn´t eat  in the restaurant, only had a breakfast, and in my opinion were really expensive, if you walked 1 o 2 street  more, you can take the same more cheap.\n",

      "Upon arrival, we weren't greeted just plain out ignored. The room is GROSS!!! There are stains on the ceiling, walls, curtains,  and sheets. No water, no ice, no coffee maker. Community soap and shampoo left from the previous guests for everyone to use. I say MOVE ON TO ANOTHER HOTEL. I asked to move rooms and was told no. I have already paid for this and we are very far from home...this sucks for the amazing 16th birthday trip we had planned. We will never be back and we will keep everyone we know from staying at the RIU!\n",

      "Place was clean.  Staff were kind and courteous. Rooms well modern and comfortable. Overall a very pleasant experience and I will definitely stay there again if I'm in town.   The breakfast was delicious, wifi was fast.  Only thing is the TV's can be upgraded so we can use our apps. \n",

      "Good location and decent room. They claim that due to COVID, they will not clean the room every dat but we stayed for 4 nights and our room was only cleaned on the first night. They offer free breakfast but they closed the service before the limit time even though we were making a line for more than 30 minutes. I read decent reviews before staying there so I was surprise of our bad experience. My recommendation, go to ANY other hotel, not the RIU Plaza Times Square.\n",
